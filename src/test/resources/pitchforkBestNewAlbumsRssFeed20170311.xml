            <title>Jay Som: Everybody Works</title>
            <link>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22982-everybody-works/</link>
            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Virtuous though it may be, patience is a difficult
                quality to capture in guitar rock, a medium that much prefers boldness, concision, and urgency. Perhaps
                that’s why Bay Area multi-instrumentalist Melina Duterte’s reverence for the human capacity to wait and
                think and grow comes across as a revelation on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Everybody
                Works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, her first official album as &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/33767-jay-som/"&gt;Jay Som&lt;/a&gt;. “Take time to figure it out,”
                she advises on lead single “&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18672-jay-som-the-bus-song/"&gt;The
                Bus Song&lt;/a&gt;.” In its context, she’s caught between relationship statuses, assuring the object of
                her fixation that she’ll “be the one who sticks around.” As an introduction to an album full of
                reminders not to rush things, though, the line is a relief, enough to make you involuntarily exhale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Bedroom pop is a genre designation that loses meaning by
                the year—not just as technology creeps closer to erasing any distinction between studio production and
                home recording, but also as the musicians associated with it develop tastes more varied and less retro
                than, say, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"&gt;Ariel Pink&lt;/a&gt;’s.
                Twenty-two-year-old Duterte made the fuzzy, dreamy, plaintive aesthetic her own on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22532-turn-into/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;Turn Into&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, nine
                self-recorded tracks she uploaded to Bandcamp on a tipsy whim over a year ago and re-released with
                Polyvinyl in late 2016, billing the makeshift debut as a collection of “finished and unfinished songs”
                rather than a proper album. Although she made &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Everybody
                Works &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;alone in her bedroom studio, its
                repertoire ranges from folk to funk to chart pop. It’s not a bedroom-pop album because it sounds a
                certain way, but because it feels so intimate. Most of Duterte’s elaborate songs could be mistaken for
                full-band compositions, yet her preference for writing and recording in solitude imbues each one with an
                introspective quality. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Liberated from the obligation to conform to any one
                sound, Duterte investigates new styles with purpose. She’s smitten with &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30955-carly-rae-jepsen/"&gt;Carly Rae Jepsen&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20898-emotion/"&gt;E•MO•TION&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and it shows in the hooky choruses of “The Bus Song” and “Remain,” two
                tracks steeped in exuberant longing. With its smooth keyboards and slinky bass line, “Baybee” comes on
                like an R&amp;amp;B slow jam, but instead of steaming up the windows, it’s about seducing yourself into
                seeing your beloved through a rough patch: “If I leave you alone/When you don’t feel right/I know we’ll
                sink for sure,” Duterte coos on top of the music, like a layer of pure calm. “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18744-jay-som-1-billion-dogs/"&gt;1 Billion Dogs&lt;/a&gt;”
                submerges anxious lyrics in a cloud of feedback that melds shoegaze, indie pop, and grunge as if it were
                a forgotten gem from the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://www.discogs.com/Various-DGC-Rarities-Vol1/release/436523" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;DGC Rarities &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;compilation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;But the most arresting songs are the ones that defy
                categorization entirely. The first minute of the album, on “Lipstick Stains,” sounds the way orchestra
                instruments might upon waking from an afternoon nap, blinking and stretching in the sunlight. When the
                vocals kick in more than halfway through the track, Duterte’s murmur is just as drowsily blissful: “I
                like the way your lipstick stains/The corner of my smile,” she breathes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Everybody Works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
                closes with “For Light,” an epic, seven-minute ballad that transforms a whispered promise—“I’ll be right
                on time/Open blinds for light/Won’t forget to climb”—into a sing-along prayer by adding in the voices of
                backup singers. The mood of weary resilience is reminiscent of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://youtu.be/kzTCbaZj5HA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Nick
                Cave’s “Push the Sky Away,”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; another
                album-closing message of encouragement that fully acknowledges the herculean effort it takes, sometimes,
                to merely keep going. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As that comparison suggests, Duterte has absorbed more of
                life’s hard lessons than most of us do by age 22. The patience that suffuses &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Everybody Works &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;doesn’t
                reflect the naïveté of a kid who’s sure she has unlimited time to chase her ambitions and find love; it
                comes out of an emotionally mature view of relationships and the 10 years of work she has already put
                into her songwriting, taking shitty jobs and enduring family strife to become the musician she is today.
                “I’ll remain under your moon,” she pledges on “Remain,” an anthem of (perhaps one-sided) commitment.
                “Everybody Works” registers Duterte’s resentment at how easily success seems to come to the “rock star”
                who make her wonder, “Did you pay your way through?” But empathy wins out in the end; she makes
                “everybody works” a mantra, repeating the phrase as though to remind herself of the way other people’s
                painstaking efforts can be invisible to us. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“All of my songs are so different, but you know it’s me,”
                Duterte remarked in a recent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/10017-jay-soms-hard-working-dream-pop/"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Pitchfork profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;.
                She’s right, and there’s no better indicator that a songwriter has found her voice than the ability to
                explore new styles and still sound like the same artist. Just a few years into her adult life, and only
                one album into her recording career, Melina Duterte has swept past a milestone many musicians never even
                get in their sights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Vagabon: Infinite Worlds</title>
            <link>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22921-vagabon-infinite-worlds/</link>
            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Just about 20 minutes into Lætitia Tamko’s compact debut
                as &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/34085-vagabon/"&gt;Vagabon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Infinite
                Worlds&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;she sings a line so cutting that,
                upon first hearing it, I had to remove my headphones and take stock of my surroundings. “What about them
                scares you so much?/My standing there threatens your standing, too,” Tamko sings on “Cleaning House,”
                broadcasting a simple but eminently resonant message that defines why these eight songs feel so
                important, especially now. It should be no secret that Tamko’s thought runs through the minds of all
                those made marginal by prejudicial thinking—and actual executive action. It could be your skin color,
                the way you dress, who you worship or love, but nonetheless that question flashes through the minds of
                those made to feel less. A simple, evocative guitar plucking in the background guides this sentiment
                with precision into the ear of listener, and down into their gut. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Yet, Tamko’s inimitable take on DIY indie rock is never
                downtrodden. It’s victorious—even when her feats feel pyrrhic. Her soaring, winsome, and mutable tenor
                is unlike any of her peers in the New York scene. She also shreds. More importantly, Tamko’s first
                proper album is a stunning document of what indie rock can look like from a viewpoint that isn’t
                necessarily widespread in the genre. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Infinite
                Worlds &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;is an album interested in grappling
                with seemingly intractable and very personal questions about sharing space, finding a home, and
                fostering community in a world that can be caustic to those very actions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Some of the songs that appear on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Infinite Worlds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
                started as rougher drafts on 2014 EP &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Persian
                Garden.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Listening to the earlier work, it’s
                clear how much Tamko has grown. She moved to New York as a teenager from Cameroon, and until she
                graduated from college &lt;/span&gt;in 2015, music was more or less a hobby. Her Bandcamp demos
                eventually led her to the Bushwick community art space Silent Barn, and a venerable DIY scene that
                includes artists like &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31974-frankie-cosmos/"&gt;Frankie Cosmos&lt;/a&gt;
                and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/32629-crying/"&gt;Crying&lt;/a&gt; (members of both bands
                contributed to &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Infinite Worlds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18646-vagabon-the-embers/"&gt;The Embers&lt;/a&gt;,” the
                album’s opener, was originally a song called “Sharks,” and it has transitioned from whispered confession
                to empowering paean. The song’s anthemic, steady guitars and booming drums recall the sound of&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"&gt; Modest Mouse&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill/"&gt;Built to Spill&lt;/a&gt;, but her voice is
                the anchor to all these songs. It’s a powerful tool that can move from soft to loud, confrontational to
                relaxing, with an uncanny grace. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Tamko shows this in songs like “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18606-vagabon-fear-force/"&gt;Fear &amp;amp; Force&lt;/a&gt;”
                and “Mal à L’aise.” On the former, she sings about a failed relationship, isolation, and the search for
                a sanctuary. “I've been hiding in the smallest space/I am dying to go/This is not my home,” Tamko sings,
                alternating between breathy harmonies and straightforward delivery (Greta Kline, aka Frankie Cosmos,
                provides backing vocals). The latter is one of the most interesting songs on the album: a piece of
                gauzy, ambient pop, not unlike the &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"&gt;Cocteau
                Twins&lt;/a&gt;. Sung completely in French, “Mal à L’aise” is a sound collage made of a spectral chorus
                of voices, processed and multiplied (including sampled vocals from &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31979-julie-byrne/"&gt;Julie Byrne&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/32436-ilovemakonnen/"&gt;Makonnen&lt;/a&gt; collaborator Eric
                Littmann). These sounds shuffle around in an indistinct musical space, which is both haunted and
                relaxed. It’s almost close to new age, conjuring up the work of &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/8602-harold-budd/"&gt;Harold Budd&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"&gt;Grouper&lt;/a&gt;, but Tamko gives the airy vibe of
                this song weight with lyrics that touch on accepting social discomfort and embracing oneself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Throughout &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Infinite Worlds,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
                Tamko interrogates what it means to occupy space with others who don’t necessarily see eye to eye, be it
                parents, peers, or strangers. Sometimes imagining that ideal world leads to bouts of doubt, or even
                magical realism (see “100 Days”). But Tamko keeps coming back to the same point: the community you want
                to live in is one you have to make. Guided by a more mature sound, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Infinite Worlds &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;is
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;the rock music we need nowadays, when it seems like
                home, wherever it might be, is getting farther away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Power Trip: Nightmare Logic</title>
            <link>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22891-power-trip-nightmare-logic/</link>
            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;No one throws a party like &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31190-power-trip/"&gt;Power Trip&lt;/a&gt;. In the years since their
                2008 inception, the Dallas crossover quintet has come to embody the platonic ideal of heavy metal
                escapism, in person and on record. Genre boundaries get blown to smithereens during their rambunctious,
                pretension-free concerts; they’ll play with anyone who’s willing to get noisy, be it New Orleans bounce
                queen &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29822-big-freedia/"&gt;Big Freedia&lt;/a&gt;, moody
                post-punk outfit &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30479-merchandise/"&gt;Merchandise&lt;/a&gt;,
                or black metal darlings &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"&gt;Deafheaven&lt;/a&gt;.
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Power Trip’s excellent debut album, 2013’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17893-power-trip-manifest-decimation/"&gt;Manifest Decimation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, further solidified this reputation by translating their live ferocity to
                wax. One album on, nine years in, Power Trip have mastered the rager. They now turn their focus &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;to
                widespread revelry with &lt;i&gt;Nightmare&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; Logic—&lt;/i&gt;a mission that goes off
                with a big, beautiful bang. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Nightmare Logic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;doesn’t find Power Trip making any significant shifts to the
                no-holds-barred approach they showcased so powerfully on their debut. It’s an LP crafted in its
                predecessor’s literal spitting image, from the proliferative gang vocals and thrash beatdowns right down
                to the eight-track runtime and gory old-school artwork. Frontman Riley Gale still huffs, puffs, and
                howls like a rabid wolf, a feral intermediary through which the band issues blistering, occasionally
                &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;loony indictments of corrupt politicians (“Ruination”) and greedy, polluting CEOs
                (“If Not Us Then Who”). Gale’s bandmates match these screeds with litanies of their own: particularly
                guitarist Blake Ibanez, a hardcore titan (&lt;a href="https://themites.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow"&gt;and occasional shoegazer&lt;/a&gt;) whose slithering riffs incessantly run amok. Even
                the audience can’t escape Power Trip’s leaden &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;censure. On “Waiting Around to Die,”
                Gale delivers this sputtering, incendiary pep talk with a rage so palpable you can almost feel it
                shaking you by the shoulders: “You’re waiting around to die, how can you live with it?/Just waiting
                around to die, AND I CAN’T FUCKING STAND IT!!!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Thrash has always been a goofy genre with a morbid sense
                of humor: a direct consequence of the genre’s primordial days in the Reagan era, when trolling the
                silent majority doubled as a pre-eminent past-time and a form of protest. Like their peers &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/32388-iron-reagan/"&gt;Iron Reagan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5920-skeletonwitch/"&gt;Skeletonwitch&lt;/a&gt;, Power Trip view the
                impending apocalypse as a cause for celebration, powered by schadenfreude. Evangelical Christians are
                treated to particularly hilarious roastings. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Executioner’s
                Tax (Swing of the Axe),” the album’s best song, sees Gale calling the bluff of all those Bible-Belters
                who’d so passionately pleaded for the arrival of the man upstairs, only to come face-to-face with the
                titular killer-for-hire when the End of Days finally arrives. “You’ve prayed for so long, and now you
                have your chance/The executioner’s here, and he’s sharpening his axe!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Power Trip’s new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt; attention to detail pushes &lt;i&gt;Nightmare Logic&lt;/i&gt; over the edge. It’s abundantly
                clear that they’ve spent hours at the dissection table with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Manifest Decimation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;, amplifying—but not recycling—its best hooks and theatrics, trimming off the static scar
                tissue. They’ve chopped a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; few seconds of extraneous
                riffing here, a repeated breakdown there; it’s an impressive operation, considering their debut was
                plenty lean and mean. The nit-picking pays off, as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;Nightmare Logic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; outmatches the
                preceding LP across all verticals, from cohesion and catchiness to impact and atmosphere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The band’s secret weapon remains producer and Sumerlands
                guitarist Arthur Rizk, or as I like to call him, the Ariel Rechtshaid of heavy music; &lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22717-forever/"&gt;Code
                Orange’s &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22717-forever/"&gt;Forever&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20463-prurient-frozen-niagara-falls/"&gt;Prurient’s &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20463-prurient-frozen-niagara-falls/"&gt;Frozen Niagara Falls&lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;are just two of the bevy of ambitious
                records he’s worked on. A master of dynamic contrast and sonic feints, Rizk’s the textbook definition of
                a board-wizard. Under his command, Ibanez’s already-huge tremolo riffs on “Executioner’s Tax”, “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18616-power-trip-firing-squad/"&gt;Firing Squad&lt;/a&gt;,”
                and the title track become hulking, like a stampede of hellish racehorses against the thundering
                backbeat. Meanwhile, in the back of the mix, the rhythm section ebbs and flows to accommodate the
                axework, ensuring sustained impact and easy passage from one ripper to the next. Rizk again runs Gale’s
                yelps through a heap of effects, rendering every syllable an echo-laden boom from on high. And in spite
                of its sheer heft, Rizk makes &lt;i&gt;Nightmare Logic&lt;/i&gt; a crisp, nuanced listen; like the band
                themselves, he strikes a rare balance between modern intricacy and old-school aggression, nodding to
                tradition without over-relying on tropes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;You don’t need to be a metalhead to have a blast with
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Nightmare Logic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. Screamed sardonics, persistent chug, and apocalyptic melodrama are all
                acquired tastes, sure. But Power Trip’s fist-pumping choruses, ricocheting grooves, and ample charm are
                so animated that they leave us with something addictive and, well, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. Just like
                Metallica, the Texans pitch a big tent, where the only prerequisite for entry is a willingness to splash
                around in the bloodbath for half an hour. With &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Nightmare
                Logic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, there’s a good chance you’ll stick
                around for a good, long soak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Thundercat: Drunk</title>
            <link>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22895-drunk/</link>
            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;Thundercat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; gives himself a pep
                talk at the beginning of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Drunk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;: “Comb your beard, brush your teeth … beat your meat, go to sleep.” At
                least he’s in marginally better spirits these days. Following the death of his friend and collaborator
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30905-austin-peralta/"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Austin Peralta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;,
                his last two releases—2013’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18156-thundercat-apocalypse/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt; and 2015’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20760-the-beyond-where-the-giants-roam/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The Beyond / Where the Giants Roam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;explored the
                concept of extinction and what the spirit might endure when the body expires. On these records—along
                with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Flying Lotus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;’
                2014 album &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19875-flying-lotus-youre-dead/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;You’re Dead!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;, where Thundercat contributed bass or vocals to many of its songs—the singer and preeminent
                bassist (born Stephen Bruner) tried to make sense of a devastating truth. Peralta was gone, and one day,
                he will be gone too. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;All this cosmic morbidity leaned on Thundercat’s music,
                which takes on many forms all at once: ’70s funk, R&amp;amp;B, punk with tinges of fusion. His art is
                undeniably black, yet the structures are loose enough to pull in all sorts of listeners. It speaks to
                those who love soul and ska equally, those who spazz just the same when &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/features/afterword/9188-george-duke/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;George
                Duke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/275-bad-brains/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Bad Brains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; flash across the iPod. Thundercat is equal parts Nintendo generation, ’60s
                flower child, and hardcore skater bro. His live show is punk as hell; serene studio tracks are given
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H19G-5_kdM" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;loud, frenetic makeovers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;. On top of all that rests Thundercat’s smooth falsetto, a transcendent voice that can usher
                you into some sort of demise (“Descent Into Madness”), sing lovingly to his pet cat (“Tron Song”), or
                make drugs seem perfectly fine (“DMT Song,” “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15410-thundercat-oh-sheit-its-x/"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Oh Sheit It’s X.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;”).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;If Thundercat’s recent work focused on the uncertainty of
                death, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Drunk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; confronts the challenge of just trying to live life. It’s a marathon
                through the mind of Bruner that uses his casually humorous and honest songwriting to detail that which
                is cool and that which sucks. Cool? Kenny Loggins and Dragon Ball Z wrist-slap bracelets. Sucks? Friend
                zones and the police state. Featuring Kendrick Lamar (“Walk on By”), Wiz Khalifa (“Drink Dat”) and
                Kamasi Washington (“Them Changes”) &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18710-thundercat-show-you-the-way-ft-michael-mcdonald-kenny-loggins/"&gt;among
                others&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Drunk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; plays like an anxious stoner album, the aural equivalent of late-night
                channel surfing. Its 23 tracks present a fluid narrative that begins on a somewhat bright note and
                gradually fades into darkness—a concept record that takes you through a bleary night of drinking, drugs,
                funk, and heartbreak with Thundercat himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;He&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is
                whimsical and somber, funny and meaningful, sometimes all at once. Each song hovers around the
                two-minute mark, defying those ‘70s fusion forebears whose tracks could drag on over dense harmonies and
                time signatures. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Drunk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; hits all the melodic and emotional themes Thundercat aims for without
                belaboring the point. On openers “Rabbot Ho” and “Captain Stupido,” he comes off a bit goofy and
                red-eyed, leaving his wallet at the club after a night of partying. “Bus in These Streets,” which
                resembles &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dddm5bQeKvg" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;the theme of 1980s children show “The Great Space Coaster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;,” uses a sarcastic nursery rhyme flow to chide our collective social media
                dependence (“Thank God for technology ‘cause where would we be if we couldn't tweet our thoughts,”
                Thundercat quips). “Jameel’s Space Ride,” a transitional song near the album’s end, uses a
                chiptune-inspired beat while he sings of the struggle between minorities and law enforcement: “I’m safe
                on my block, except for the cops/Will they attack, would it be ‘cause I’m black?” This, of course, is
                after he literally meows about how cool it must be to be a cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;All this oddball soul feels more anchored to Thundercat's humanity than his
                previous releases. We see him here as both a heartbroken insomniac, someone who looks at the world
                alongside &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Pharrell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; on
                “The Turn Down” and wonders if “everything we do is weak,” and a juvenile jazzbo who wants to “blow all
                [his] cash on anime.” Much like &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15758-the-golden-age-of-apocalypse/"&gt;The Golden Age of
                Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, which leapfrogged several different genres with dizzying results, he’s
                able to keep it all together, offering a puzzling ride that feels coherent despite its moving parts.
                Unlike his past work, which put his musicianship on great display, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Drunk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; presents
                the defining picture of Thundercat as a person: quirky, political, thoughtful, weird—and sometimes
                drunk. These descriptors aren’t surprising &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;if you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://twitter.com/Thundercat" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; follow
                him on Twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, but here, Thundercat comes
                off like the guy who you can hit up at the bar and riff on pretty much anything. Given all he’s gone
                through personally, it’s an honor to hear Thundercat feeling like himself again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;So far, Spencer Doran’s mixtapes have overshadowed his actual albums. In 2010, the Portland,
                Oregon, producer posted &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://rootstrata.com/rootblog/?p=3706" target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow"&gt;Fairlights, Mallets and Bamboo—Fourth-World Japan, Years 1980–1986&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,
                a stunning collection of early-’80s Japanese synthesizer music by artists like Yellow Magic Orchestra’s
                Haruomi Hosono and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3683-ryuichi-sakamoto/"&gt;Ryuichi Sakamoto&lt;/a&gt;.
                While not a party-starting DJ set, it was in its own meticulous, contemplative way, influential; you can
                hear its sensibility course through later works by the likes of &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"&gt;Oneohtrix Point Never&lt;/a&gt;,
                &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28027-neon-indian/"&gt;Neon Indian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/33780-motion-graphics/"&gt;Motion Graphics&lt;/a&gt;, and the entire
                vaporwave contingency. A second volume followed, as did another series, &lt;a
                href="http://rootstrata.com/rootblog/?p=7819" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Music Interiors&lt;/a&gt;,
                cementing Doran’s status as an innovative curator of now-obscure sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But despite the bubbling ambience and generally high quality of Doran and partner Ryan
                Carlile’s 2015 debut album as &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/34095-visible-cloaks/"&gt;Visible
                Cloaks&lt;/a&gt;, the initial full-length was overshadowed by the earlier mixes. On their second album,
                &lt;i&gt;Reassemblage&lt;/i&gt;, however, the duo fully absorb these far-flung influences, weaving the
                strands into something delicate yet decidedly original. Lullaby-like though compositionally rigorous,
                serene but slightly unsettled, organic and synthetic, &lt;i&gt;Reassemblage&lt;/i&gt; strikes an
                intriguing balance between extremes.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Like Daniel Lopatin, James Ferraro, and Laurel Halo did during the short reign of &lt;a
                href="https://www.discogs.com/label/204958-Hippos-In-Tanks" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hippos in
                Tanks&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the decade, Visible Cloaks scrutinize the once-novel digital sounds that
                now riddle modern pop and envelop us in our everyday lives. Just don’t call Visible Cloaks
                “vaporwave”—if anything, &lt;i&gt;Reassemblage&lt;/i&gt; is the antithesis of that trend. While on the
                surface there is a shared obsession with the cleanliness of early digital music and the Japanese pop
                culture that helped usher it in the early ‘80s, what Doran and Carlile do with the raw material stands
                apart.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Scroll through the Discogs page for &lt;a href="https://www.discogs.com/lists/Vaporwave/191566"
                target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;vaporwave&lt;/a&gt; and almost any title bears either a visual wink or
                track title that mimics Japanese script. As an &lt;a
                href="http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a47793/what-happened-to-vaporwave/" target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Esquire&lt;/i&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; proclaiming that vaporwave was dead posited
                last year, the genre itself was a “musical parody of pop consciousness… [a] sarcastic take on the
                unachieved utopias of previous decades.” But as &lt;i&gt;Fairlights, Mallets, and Bamboo&lt;/i&gt;
                showed, there was a deeper investigation into the music beyond a mocking appropriation of a cool
                surface. The title itself comes from Vietnamese filmmaker/theorist Trinh T. Minh-ha's 1982 film &lt;i&gt;Reassemblage&lt;/i&gt;,
                a documentary filmed in Senegal that doubles as a tacit admission that one can never fully decipher
                another culture. While never able to fully grasp the Japanese sounds they adore, Visible Cloaks
                nevertheless have created an album along the axis of Fennesz’s &lt;i&gt;Endless Summer&lt;/i&gt; and
                OPN’s &lt;i&gt;Replica&lt;/i&gt;, an abstract electronic album that’s readily accessible and an
                immersive listen.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Visible Cloaks specialize in blurring boundaries, as they collapse organic sounds into
                precisely machined new shapes. “Mask” works from a palette closest to those Root Strata mixes, as
                gamelan bowls, bird calls, and vocodered hums are stretched and processed like a &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1477-fennesz/"&gt;Fennesz&lt;/a&gt; track. “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18613-visible-cloaks-terrazzo-ft-motion-graphics/"&gt;Terrazzo&lt;/a&gt;”
                has Doran and Carlile team up with Motion Graphics’ Joe Williams, taking his flute and elongating it
                until it more closely resembles a shakuhachi bamboo version. Around this timbre, the duo stir a marsh of
                small blips, twinkling crystals, and koto strings, a strange sensation of natural ambience and glitching
                electronics blending into an alien landscape. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Even when working with thoroughly synthetic tones, Cloaks tease them out so that they clench
                and exhale, emerging as digital blips that seem as natural as breath. Water sounds gush out of “Screen,”
                but rather than replicate new age nature sounds, the frequencies become high and crinkled, like the
                baldly fake cellophane sea of Frederico Fellini’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://www.tasteofcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/And-The-Ship-Sails-On.jpg" target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow"&gt;And the Ship Sails On&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. “Valve” continues with that gentle pacing,
                this time featuring the crystalline vocals of Miyako Koda, one-half of Japanese elegant ’80s group Dip
                in the Pool. Curiously, the group didn’t factor into any of Doran’s mixes, but “Valve” sounds like a
                lost &lt;i&gt;Bamboo&lt;/i&gt; selection with its deliberate mallets and misty chords. Koda is the
                perfect fit here and the duo shadows her already gossamer voice with what might be puffs of steam on
                glass rods.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Water, glass, cellophane, crystals, glass—these metaphors suggest sound that can at once seem
                transparent and featureless. But Visible Cloaks take pains to pivot their compositions every so often,
                so that light catches off the sleek edges and a full spectrum of color suddenly appears. And as the
                album glides along, Cloaks moves away from the easy Hosono and Sakamoto comparisons. “Circle”—with its
                slivers of voices, strings, and woodwinds—sounds exacting in its every gesture, bringing to mind modern
                composition rather than laptop mincing. &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18733-visible-cloaks-neume-ft-matt-carlson/"&gt;“Neume”—named
                for an early form of musical notation&lt;/a&gt;—finds the Cloaks collaborating with fellow Portlander
                &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30633-matt-carlson/"&gt;Matt Carlson&lt;/a&gt;. They Auto-Tune
                his voice, but also warp it until he starts to resemble the polyphonic chants of a medieval organum.
                It’s one of &lt;i&gt;Reassemblage&lt;/i&gt;’s loveliest moments and reveals Visible Cloaks’ essential
                appeal, not where East meets West so much as where ancient music anticipates its digital future.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Julie Byrne: Not Even Happiness</title>
            <link>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22743-not-even-happiness/</link>
            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;There are two things you can’t escape: the sky and
                yourself. It serves us, then, to understand both. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;Not Even Happiness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, the pristine
                new album from singer-songwriter &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31979-julie-byrne/"&gt;Julie
                Byrne&lt;/a&gt;, probes cosmic notions such as these with wonder and aplomb. Wanderer, dreamer,
                naturist, loner, romantic—with her bold fingerpicking and deep voice, Byrne makes these well-worn
                identities feel newly alive. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Not Even
                Happiness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; has all the lucidity and
                tactility of a healing crystal—or more to the point, a rose quartz, the one that might help you to
                love. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Blending folk, new age, and silence, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Not Even Happiness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
                is a balm. In both sound and sensibility, it strives for clarity, that ultimate marker of enlightenment.
                Orchestral arrangements sit subtly in the mix; an occasional flute slides in, or a sample of crashing
                waves. Byrne solemnly charts the places she’s seen—Kansas, Arkansas, Montana, Wyoming—and fills her
                lyrics with elemental things. She lies in a “verdant field,” catches “stars from a back porch,” watches
                a “dove over the prairie.” Her language is diffuse, braiding together themes of autonomy, desire, and
                struggle, but despite the heft of her poetry, the music exudes disarming ease. It feels much shorter
                than its 33 minutes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Not Even Happiness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; imagines a cross-section of &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen/"&gt;Leonard Cohen&lt;/a&gt;’s mysticism and &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4153-judee-sill/"&gt;Judee Sill&lt;/a&gt;’s vulnerability—like the
                latter artist, Byrne’s keen pop sense and stacked harmonies play out like wind carrying her along.
                “Because they take themselves lightly, angels can fly,” the philosopher Alan Watts notes in his book
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Become What You Are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and Byrne seems to mind this idea sonically. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Byrne named her album&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Not Even Happiness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt; because happiness, perhaps, is not always the point. There are virtues beyond
                happiness—strength, wisdom, integrity, self-possession—and Byrne honors these. Though she is a nomad,
                she doesn’t romanticize the position; her rootlessness sounds more like a calling, one that chose her,
                with sacrifices and doubts. “I have dragged my lives across the country/And wondered if travel led me
                anywhere,” Byrne sings on “I Live Now As a Singer,” conjuring the sweep of &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4217-this-mortal-coil/"&gt;This Mortal Coil&lt;/a&gt;’s “Song to the
                Siren.” She sounds devoted to an inner compass only. On opener “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18644-julie-byrne-follow-my-voice/"&gt;Follow My Voice&lt;/a&gt;,”
                Byrne sings, “I was made for the green, made to be alone,” and she prioritizes her solitude with a sly
                turn: “I’ve been called heartbreaker/For doing justice to my own.” Not unlike &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6029-phil-elverum/"&gt;Phil Elverum&lt;/a&gt;, Byrne paints sublime,
                awestruck moments when simple things become overwhelming. “Will I know a truer time/Than when I stood
                alone in the snow,” she sings. “And the moon was in the sky and shone.” Nearly a capella, she intones,
                “I’ve been seeking God within.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Despite this self-reliance, these are patently love
                songs, processing the unravelling of a heart sewn shut. The human heart is never easy in a Byrne song,
                though, by nature of its connection to an active human mind. Byrne knows the difference between solitude
                and loneliness, and she bears the lessons of the former while endeavoring the enormous task of
                navigating the latter with dignity. On “Morning Dove,” her tone evokes &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4572-gillian-welch/"&gt;Gillian Welch&lt;/a&gt;, as she vividly
                paints her surroundings—the woods, the endless river—but sweetly admits to trailing off: “I thought of
                you so presently,” she sings. “I could not wait to tell you the truth.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Gleaming and steadied and wide, “Sleepwalker” is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Not Even Happiness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;’
                most gripping moment. It captures both the infatuated feeling of nascent love and how a dream of life
                can tempt you to lose control of your own. “I traveled only in service of my dreams,” Byrne sings, “I
                stood before them all/I was a sleepwalker.” Few contemporary songwriters earn a comparison to &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29064-angel-olsen/"&gt;Angel Olsen&lt;/a&gt;, but in its acuity and
                grace—what Leonard Cohen called “that kind of balance with which you ride the chaos that you find around
                you”—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Not Even Happiness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; makes a case for Byrne as one of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Throughout &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Not Even Happiness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;,
                Byrne sounds like a person who might worship the sky, but the majestic “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18614-julie-byrne-natural-blue/"&gt;Natural Blue&lt;/a&gt;” is
                a proper ode. There’s nothing particularly unusual about her tale of driving through familiar
                southwestern towns on tour, but her images evoke the life-affirming feeling of catching the exquisite
                light just so through a moving car window, while meditating on the changing scenery as it flickers by.
                “When I first saw you/That feeling, it came over me, too/Natural blue,” Byrne sings. Were “Natural Blue”
                released a decade ago, perhaps the poet Maggie Nelson would have found something in it to include in her
                2009 prose-poem &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Bluets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, a radiant reflection on the color. “When I was alive, I aimed to be a
                student not of longing but of light” goes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Bluets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;’ final sentence, and a similar logic guides &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Not Even Happiness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;,
                in which the most worthy wandering happens on roads within.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Sampha: Process</title>
            <link>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22831-process/</link>
            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;When &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31502-sampha/"&gt;Sampha&lt;/a&gt; Sisay was three years old, his
                father brought a piano into the family’s Morden, England home. It wasn’t a grand gesture—just a way to
                get his sons &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thefader.com/2016/06/28/sampha-cover-story-interview"
                target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;away from the TV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. Yet for Sampha, the youngest of five siblings, the instrument became a
                vessel for his personal growth. It helped enlighten the young boy, offering solace and purpose,
                commencing a spiritual journey that he’s still navigating. In Sampha’s world, the piano is one of the
                few things that’s always been there. It’s never gotten sick or faded away from disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“You would show me I had something some people call a soul,” he sings on “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18667-sampha-no-one-knows-me-like-the-piano/"&gt;(No One Knows
                Me) Like the Piano&lt;/a&gt;,” a gorgeous ballad and one of many standouts from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;,
                Sampha’s remarkable debut album.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The song—much like the LP—comes from a deeply meditative
                place, reflecting the innermost thoughts of a man still coping with heavy loss. His father, Joe, passed
                away from lung cancer in 1998. His mother, Binty Sisay, died of cancer in September 2015. Throughout the
                spare electro-soul of &lt;i&gt;Process&lt;/i&gt;, you feel his mom’s spirit in the stillness, pushing
                her son in his quest for understanding. Sampha’s endured his own health struggles as well. He once
                discovered a lump in his throat while on tour; despite an endoscopy, doctors couldn’t determine a cause.
                It&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; became a catalyst for the singer to assess his own
                mortality here. “Sleeping with my worries,” goes the opener “Plastic 100ºC,” “I didn’t really know what
                that lump was.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sampha’s career dates back to 2010 and the release of
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://sundanza.bandcamp.com/releases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sundanza&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;,
                his first EP. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In 2011, Sampha was featured heavily on
                producer SBTRKT’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15607-sbtrkt/"&gt;debut album&lt;/a&gt;; h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;is second EP, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18419-sampha-dual-ep/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Dual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;,
                followed in 2013. Sampha played the background from there, turning up on tracks with &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"&gt;Drake&lt;/a&gt; (“Too Much,” “The Motion”), &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"&gt;Kanye West&lt;/a&gt; (“Saint Pablo”), &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"&gt;Frank Ocean&lt;/a&gt; (“Alabama”), and &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/26010-solange/"&gt;Solange&lt;/a&gt; (“&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18552-solange-dont-touch-my-hair-ft-sampha/"&gt;Don’t Touch My
                Hair&lt;/a&gt;”). His presence was strong, even if his voice—a gentle, shimmering falsetto—added light
                touches to the scenery. Despite its delicate texture, Sampha’s inflection hovers perfectly above the
                music, cracking at certain pitches to convey grief.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In a way, &lt;i&gt;Process&lt;/i&gt; feels like a concept album on which Sampha rediscovers
                himself. The musician’s mother was diagnosed with cancer the same year &lt;i&gt;Sundaza&lt;/i&gt; came
                out, and as her primary caregiver, he naturally focused his attention on her well-being. Now, he’s
                attempting to reconnect with his core while coping with despair. &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In
                the past, he’d mix his voice to fit within the instrumental; on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, he
                makes it the focal point. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Co-produced with Rodaidh
                McDonald, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Process &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;brings to mind &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;James
                Blake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; while nodding to mainstream hip-hop.
                On “Under,” in particular, Sampha utilizes a sleek trap beat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;ven
                the album’s most upbeat tracks are shaded with tension. “You’ve been with me since the cradle,” Sampha
                recalls on “Kora Sings,” presumably referring to his mom. “You’ve been with me, you’re my angel, please
                don’t you disappear.” With “&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18512-sampha-blood-on-me/"&gt;Blood
                on Me&lt;/a&gt;,” the album’s second single, the vocalist sings through heavy breaths, seemingly haunted
                by his own insecurities. It addresses the fear of moving forward after personal trauma, and for a quiet
                soul like Sampha, it also speaks to the panic of navigating the world by himself. “I’m on this road
                now,” he exclaims. “I’m so alone now/Swerving out of control now.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;On album closer “What Shouldn’t I Be?,” you feel Sampha’s
                air of prolonged detachment. It catches the singer at his most vulnerable, trying to remember the
                sketches of his childhood. Close your eyes, and you can almost see Sampha’s family—happy, affectionate,
                and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;together&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. “I should visit my brother,” he ponders, “but I haven’t been there in
                months.” His self-imposed isolation doesn’t outweigh the song’s overall premise: “You can always come
                home.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Priests: Nothing Feels Natural</title>
            <link>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22740-nothing-feels-natural/</link>
            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Fire-starting D.C. punks &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31119-priests/"&gt;Priests&lt;/a&gt; started work on their
                transcendent debut several years before election day, so don’t blame them if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Nothing Feels Natural&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt; feels relevant in the extreme at this moment. Since debuting with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Tape One&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; five
                years ago, the four-piece have never stopped shredding through corrupt power hierarchies and attempting
                to disentangle personal freedom from consumer choice. Across two tapes, a single, and an EP, they’ve
                used a deranged sort of surf rock to launch lucid, grimly funny&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;exposés of the false binaries and systemic oppressions that built America.
                This, after all, is the band that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIIZg93XHlE"
                target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;screamed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, “Barack Obama killed something in me and I’m gonna get him for it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As we enter 2017, we’re in danger of tying every faintly
                despairing new piece of culture to the ascent of America’s Cheeto-in-Chief, as if January 20 flipped a
                switch that instantly soured all milk. But i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;njustice
                wasn’t born earlier this month; it just became apparent to many who never had much cause to worry about
                it before. And the lyrics to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Nothing Feels
                Natural&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; show the existential weight of
                having spent a lifetime fighting. Priests’ debut has an entirely different energy from their previous
                releases, expanding into a rich diorama of stinging guitar, funk, yearning indie pop, and jazz. The leap
                in range and ambition from their 2015 EP &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19419-priests-bodies-and-control-and-money-and-power/"&gt;Bodies
                and Control and Money and Power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
                is huge: There hasn’t been a punk debut this certain and poised since &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30435-savages/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Savages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17977-savages-silence-yourself/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Silence Yourself&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The title works a few different ways. There’s the obvious
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;what the fuck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; sensation that accompanies your early morning Twitter scroll these days,
                and Priests have always done a mean line in sardonic disbelief. There’s less of that on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Nothing Feels Natural&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;, though it’s no less potent: “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18597-priests-pink-white-house/"&gt;Pink White House&lt;/a&gt;”
                is a hostile cheerleader chant about the illusion of choice, where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;the disorientation mounts alongside Taylor Mulitz’s spiraling bass. On the
                boisterously funky “Puff,” Katie Alice Greer sneers at accelerationism—the crackpot academic theory that
                society hitting rock bottom is good because it will surely engender radical change. And on “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18568-priests-jj/"&gt;JJ&lt;/a&gt;,” she balks at how easily
                we let branding influence the way we construct identity. “I thought I was a cowboy because I smoked
                Reds,” Greer wails, as surf riffs and battered piano behind her evoke a debauched saloon caper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Priests have always had a keen eye for fakery and
                bullshit, though on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Nothing Feels Natural&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, they’re confronting ‘normalcy’, a force far more insidious than artifice,
                because the partisan values informing it are invisible. “It’s a long movie, a long movie/And you are not
                you, you are not you,” Greer exhorts on opener “Appropriate.” Adding saxophone, piano and hand
                percussion to their sound, they change direction from song to song much in the same way that &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/771-the-clash/"&gt;the Clash&lt;/a&gt; did with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sandinista!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;,
                and commit to every hairpin turn. “Appropriate” hurtles from spiny sloganeering through nihilistic
                thrash to a condemned doom jazz wasteland, leaving the listener as alienated as Priests feel. The title
                track brings to mind rain-thrashed British indie pop, and on “Suck,” Priests try their hand at nimble
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/7812-esg/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;-indebted funk, though Greer’s frustrated pleas expose the dark underbelly
                of the New Yorkers’ effervescent cool. She had to stop screaming because it was killing her throat. The
                desperation in her singing voice might be more jarring than her howls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Priests have always been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://priests.bandcamp.com/track/usa-incantations" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;thrillingly direct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;,
                but that hasn’t stopped their words being twisted by publicists who want to profit from them (“You hinge
                your success on that which you might bleed from me,” Greer sneers on “Nicki”) and guilty parties who
                interpret their calls for respect as personal attacks (“Please don’t make me be someone with no
                sympathy,” she pleads on “Suck”). Here, they sound unusually worn down by commodification, a lack of
                good faith from those around them, and the difficulty of surviving as a punk band: the title &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Nothing Feels Natural&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt; could also signify that the abyss has started to feel like home. We’re told that this is where
                punk thrives, at the bottom of the barrel—accelerationism, again. Priests reject that idea in the most
                forceful terms. Led by drummer Daniele Daniele in a relentless, disbelieving sing-speak, the terrifying
                “No Big Bang” peers into the void of shame and failure that accompanies creativity. On the title track,
                a depressed Greer satirizes the sacrifices she’d make to feel balanced again. “If I go without for days
                will I finally hallucinate a real thing?” she pleads. The self becomes a slippery concept: “People are
                born and dying inside of me all the time,” Greer sings on “Lelia 20.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;When kakistocracy reigns and George Orwell’s &lt;i&gt;1984&lt;/i&gt;
                is a bestseller again, you might wonder if now’s the best time for Priests to get introspective. But
                their insistence on wriggling free from definition and feeling the weight of darkness has roots in
                resistance. On “Nicki,” which rings with cavernous dread, Greer intones, “I don’t make friends easily or
                naturally,” sliding over the consonants like an eel escaping grasping hands. Priests’ insistence on
                mutable identity, and their disinterest in pinning down a 10-point plan to vanquish fascism, let them
                slip free of those who seek to gentrify, identify, commodify.&lt;/span&gt; I&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;n a society where it’s becoming increasingly apparent to everyone that your words can and will
                be used against you, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Nothing Feels Natural&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is a valuable philosophy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Migos: Culture</title>
            <link>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22777-culture/</link>
            <description>
                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Okay, just for a second—as a thought experiment—let’s treat &lt;i&gt;Culture&lt;/i&gt;
                as the sophomore album from the &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"&gt;Migos&lt;/a&gt;.
                In this reality, it marks a sharp improvement from the North Atlanta trio’s debut, 2015’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20843-yung-rich-nation/"&gt;Yung Rich Nation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,
                an album that showed a tremendous amount of technical dexterity, but stiffer writing and only
                half-formed pop instincts. The &lt;span class="il"&gt;Migos&lt;/span&gt; are better now, we’d say. They
                really grew.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the real world, of course, &lt;i&gt;Culture&lt;/i&gt; comes in a long, long line
                of hits, mixtapes, and one-offs. Since “Versace” and &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18264-migos-yrn-young-rich-niggas/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Y.R.N. (Young
                Rich Niggas)&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/a&gt;marked their breakthrough in 2013, they’ve been one of the most
                influential acts in hip-hop, and frequently one of the best. Their most obvious mark on the culture has
                been the tight, triplet-laced flow they resurrected and perfected. They also brought the dab to the
                world at large, and injected a handful of slang terms into the syntaxes of aspiring rappers from coast
                to coast.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So &lt;i&gt;Culture&lt;/i&gt; arrives in what feels like the second act of a long
                career, by rap standards. The &lt;span class="il"&gt;Migos&lt;/span&gt; came out as young upstarts,
                suffered through a litany of legal hang-ups and incarcerations, had short creative dry spells where they
                sniped at the kids on the lawn stealing their styles, and eventually came back around. This time, they
                have a #1 hit in tow, and they want to stick at the top of the commercial pyramid.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The first voice you hear on &lt;i&gt;Culture&lt;/i&gt; is &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4873-dj-khaled/"&gt;DJ Khaled&lt;/a&gt;’s, which couldn’t be more
                misleading. This isn’t a big-budget parade of set pieces and stunt casting; if anything, it’s remarkable
                for how long stretches of it are sober, somber.&lt;i&gt; Culture&lt;/i&gt;’s midpoint is the phenomenal,
                &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/33949-zaytoven/"&gt;Zaytoven&lt;/a&gt;-produced “Big on Big,”
                which is towering and defiant, and even flips their well-documented label troubles into a point of
                pride. That track is followed by two more (“What the Price,” “Brown Paper Bag”) that stick to minor keys
                and contemplative piano. There are plenty of stray prescription pills and idle threats to go around, but
                they’ve been reassembled to be eerier, more perilous. (Incidentally, this would have been a perfect
                place to insert “Cocoon,” their staggering loosie from last year.)&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Culture&lt;/i&gt; is front-loaded with singles, which—perhaps
                counter-intuitively—makes for a nice balance. Heard back-to-back-to-back, “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18663-migos-t-shirt/" target="_blank"
                data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18663-migos-t-shirt/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1485909354326000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFT5jjqwWm_s5pH7YUIk-_jjm9aUQ"&gt;T-Shirt&lt;/a&gt;,”
                “Call Casting,” and “Bad and Boujee” are not only packed with color and virtuosic rapping, but elucidate
                exactly what each of the three rappers bring to the table, how they complement one another. Hearing
                Quavo float is a joy, but it’s even better when it’s underscored by Takeoff’s bass and Offset’s
                serration. There are also fascinating reconciliations: The Cardo-produced, &lt;a&gt;2 Chainz&lt;/a&gt;-featuring
                “Deadz” seems to find a middle ground between the sparse Atlanta sounds and Chicago’s maximalism that
                were warring around the time of &lt;i&gt;Y.R.N&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Then there are truly strange moments. “All Ass,” from the album’s (uh) back end,
                sounds like Magic City mixed with industrial Berlin. “Slippery,” in an inspired move, turns a “skrrt
                skrrt” ad-lib into the song’s melodic backbone. Even when &lt;i&gt;Culture&lt;/i&gt; grasps for the
                radio dial, it skirts expectations. The arc here is not one of artists leaving their roots to chase
                pop—it’s pop coming back around to accommodate them.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While the &lt;span class="il"&gt;Migos&lt;/span&gt; are decidedly of Atlanta (coupled
                with some cadences from up in Tennessee), their records frequently remind you of rap’s earlier years,
                when creative kids holed up in bedrooms and tried to impress or make each other laugh—think &lt;i&gt;The
                &lt;span class="il"&gt;Migos&lt;/span&gt; Is Dead&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Bizarre Ride II Nawfside&lt;/i&gt;.
                &lt;i&gt;Culture&lt;/i&gt; might have national aspirations, but it’s charged with the energy of history,
                of family. On “What the Price,” Takeoff raps about the teachers and preachers of his youth who presented
                an inaccessible, exclusionary path forward. When he shirks that (“I’ma go find me a better route”), it’s
                not flippant, it’s resolute.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Later on the same song, Offset runs through a consumer fever dream, anchored by the
                line “I don’t plan on going out sad today.” In other contexts, that might be a curious aside, but over
                Ricky Racks, 808Godz and KeanuBeats’ somber track, it sounds like the album’s spiritual center. The &lt;span
                class="il"&gt;Migos are (probably) not &lt;a
                href="http://www.complex.com/music/2015/01/migos-better-than-the-beatles" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;better
                than the Beatles,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; but their existence shouldn’t be reduced to memes that debate
                the issue. On &lt;i&gt;Culture, &lt;/i&gt;their world is richly rendered, full of hopes and paranoia and
                unbridled joy. This gives the &lt;span class="il"&gt;Migos&lt;/span&gt; the last laugh on those who
                thought they’d never crack the retail album format, marked all the while by the knowledge they never
                needed one to succeed. It’s a definitive work.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The xx: I See You</title>
            <link>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22727-i-see-you/</link>
            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"&gt;The xx&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13400-xx/"&gt;self-titled debut&lt;/a&gt; remains one of the
                great sleeper hits of the last decade. No one—including, it’s fair to say, the xx themselves—expected
                that their murmuring blend of turn-of-the-millennium R&amp;amp;B and C86 indie pop would go on to sell a
                million copies and become &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1403-8-songs-that-borrow-from-the-xxs-playbook/"&gt;hugely
                influential&lt;/a&gt;. But from the beginning, the London trio had a lot going for them. In Romy Madley
                Croft and Oliver Sim, they had two songwriters conversant in the primal language of heartbreak and loss,
                whose vocals, though limited, conveyed anguish. Madley Croft’s guitar lines did a great deal with very
                little, the single notes carving deep feeling out of broad subjects. And producer and programmer &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29228-jamie-xx/"&gt;Jamie xx&lt;/a&gt;, with his unerring ability to
                find rhythms that fit with emotions, made sure each tune got its perfect beat.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17022-coexist/"&gt;Coexist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
                from 2012 was a decent re-statement of the debut’s animating ideas, but the prevailing story of the xx
                in the years since that debut has been the rise of Jamie xx. The most exciting music coming out of their
                camp—from one-off singles like “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12215-jamie-xx-far-nearer/"&gt;Far Nearer&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16969-jamie-smith-all-under-one-roof-raving/"&gt;All Under One
                Roof Raving&lt;/a&gt;” to his 2015 breakthrough &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20458-in-colour/"&gt;In Colour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;—&lt;/i&gt;belonged
                to him. The xx was all about working within limitations, with a prescribed set of sounds and themes;
                Jamie xx’s solo music was built around samples, and was, accordingly, wide open, bound only by his
                adventurous ear. &lt;i&gt;I See You&lt;/i&gt;, the third album by the xx, sounds like an attempt to
                incorporate everyone’s talents into a new version of their sound, one true to their roots but richer and
                more varied.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;On their first two albums, the xx limited their arrangements so that the songs could be
                performed live. But here, Jamie xx’s samples form the backbone of several songs, allowing them to move
                into territory that would be impossible with a guitar/bass/programmed-percussion set up. An early
                single, “&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18605-the-xx-on-hold/"&gt;On Hold&lt;/a&gt;,”
                even cops a mangled hook from a &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5826-hall-and-oates/"&gt;Hall
                and Oates&lt;/a&gt; song. It’s a quintessential Jamie xx sample, easily recognizable the moment you hear
                it but taking a moment to place, allowing your memory to fill in the blanks as the song moves and
                changes around it. Heard on its own late last year, “On Hold” sounded slightly forced, but it makes
                perfect sense as a brighter, poppier part of a record that takes the essential xx subject of uncertain
                love to near-concept album status. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As much as the expansive production helps move things forward, this is in many ways Madley
                Croft and Sim’s album. Both have grown as vocalists. Neither has tremendous range or depth, but they’re
                clever and resourceful singers, able to shape meaning through subtle inflections and shifts in phrasing.
                Sim’s approach is more face-to-face and straightforward—he seems like he’s holding up his end of a
                conversation—while Madley Croft seems like she’s talking to a mirror, trying to steel herself to share
                her feelings with the world. The delivery of every line is considered, as the pair tug at the edges of
                lines to get the expression just right. “I just don’t re-mem-ber,” Sim sings, drawing out the final
                syllable in “Say Something Loving,” imparting an additional touch of longing without overreaching; “Here
                come my insecurities/I almost expect you to leave,” Madley Croft sings in the same song, nearly summing
                up the record’s lyrical concerns in a single line.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The defining characteristics of these voices are helplessness, fear, and hurt; the xx sound
                quite far from the indie pop of their debut stylistically, but they retain their connection to that
                world because they still traffic in shy introspection and vulnerability. For the narrators of these
                songs, there’s a constant war between how the world sees them and how they feel inside, and self-love
                isn’t part of the equation. On “Performance,” Madley Croft sings about keeping up appearances, giving
                the illusion that everything is OK when she’s dying inside. “Brave for You” is a tribute to her deceased
                parents, but it could be about anyone who believes in you more than you believe in yourself. All the
                existential wrestling—interior vs. exterior, the promises and betrayals—happens in the closest of
                spaces; “My name on your lips/Your air in my lungs/Drowned in oxygen,” sings Madley Croft on “Lips,”
                sketching out just how close and intimate this world is.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;“Performance” and “Brave for You” both feel like classic xx songs—they are naked and spare,
                with hints of strings and Madley Croft’s guitar and a whole lot of silence. About a third of the album
                works with stripped-down, open arrangements like this, while others make judicious use of samples and
                layers of synths and sequencers. “Dangerous” opens the album with a startling blast of a horns that
                returns on the chorus as a counterpoint melody. “A Violent Noise” has a winding and surging cluster of
                arpeggiating notes that explode at all the right moments—something of a Jamie xx trademark—and the
                production brilliantly traces the emotional arc of the song.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As an album, &lt;i&gt;I See You&lt;/i&gt; has the eerily seamless wholeness of the self-titled
                debut, a smooth and polished object with no visible edges. If it came apart, you would almost certainly
                never be able to put it back together again. As such, each individual song seems most realized in the
                context of the album, as it builds on or tweaks or develops what came before and hints at something to
                come, and the closing “Test Me” ties it altogether. The song’s production is breathtaking, one of Jamie
                xx’s masterpieces, all &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"&gt;Eno&lt;/a&gt;-like
                suggestion, and the words are both simple and move the record’s narrative forward. “Test me,” both
                Madley Croft and Sim sing, “see if I break,” suggesting an unspoken strength that might have been there
                all along.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;On 2006’s “That’s Life,” Killer Mike boasted “You’d be
                hard-pressed to find another rapper smart as me,” opening up about Cornel West and Michael Eric Dyson,
                poverty, respectability politics, and civil rights, before taking on both Bush Administrations (“George
                Bush don’t like blacks … and his daddy CIA had flooded the hood with rock”). A few months later, El-P
                was waging war with the same enemy in the 9/11 conspiracy theory thriller “Run the Numbers,” concluding
                that “it always comes back to a Bush.” The two songs sounded very little alike, but the music (and the
                rappers) shared a similar fire and presence: confident, conspiratorial, no-holds-barred, and
                razor-sharp. Neither were likely to be deemed “political” rappers then, but both were already dissenters
                and nonconformists; independent artists signed to themselves, free thinkers shooting off at the mouth.
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Nearly a decade after airing out the Bush family, the
                duo, as Run the Jewels, have found a creative renaissance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;The group’s latest self-titled album, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Run
                the Jewels 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, is a well timed, finely tuned
                rap epic that confronts the ruling class (here addressed as “the masters”) with deadly precision; it’s
                rap as resistance.With a demagogue waiting in the wings to assume the presidency, their particular
                Molotov mix of explosive shit-talking and unfiltered insubordination feels vital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Their interplay is instinctual this time around; the
                songs move and shuffle with its MCs intuitively trading bars, filling the gaps in each others’ phrases,
                and feeding off each others’ energies, using their booming voices to cut through the startling noises of
                a future dystopia. “Poor folk love us the rich hate our faces/We talk too loud, won't remain in our
                places,” El-P raps on “Everybody Stay Calm.” They’re both observers who refuse to sugarcoat. “I just try
                my best, man, to say something about the shit I see,” Killer Mike told &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://newrepublic.com/article/124428/rebel-without-pause" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The New Republic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; in 2015. “Because I don’t want to go crazy. I don’t want to be walking
                around angry and feeling rage.” To that end, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;RTJ3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; isn’t a response or reaction, it’s a preemptive strike, laying the
                groundwork for the battleground ahead. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Their methods remain consistent, but the stakes have been
                raised over the years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;RTJ1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; was a fun experiment; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;RTJ2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; was a classicist statement,
                and now &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;RTJ3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is a reckoning. M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;any of
                these songs have more urgency than before; If &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;RTJ2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; was the music of protest, then this is the music of revolt. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In that way, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;RTJ3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is essentially the Run the Jewels manifesto, an outpouring of rage and
                defiance that is never overcome by the moment and never loses sight of the objectives: rallying the
                troops, holding everyone accountable (from lawmakers, to other rappers, to Don Lemon and themselves),
                and toppling oppression wherever it may reign (on “Thieves! (Screamed the Ghost),” El-P raps, “Fear’s
                been law for so long rage feels like therapy”). “Thursday in the Danger Room” peers into the duo's
                personal turmoil and their shared history, and on “2100” Killer Mike lays out their President-Trump
                survival strategy: “You defeat the devil when you hold onto hope.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The key to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;RTJ3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is closer “A Report to the Shareholders,” which is plainspoken about the
                duo’s message and intent: “Maybe that’s why me and Mike get along / Not from the same part of town, but
                we both hear the same sound coming / And it sounds like war.” Seconds later, Killer Mike goes full
                Malcolm X: “Choose the lesser of the evil people, and the devil still gon’ win / It could all be over
                tomorrow, kill our masters and start again.” This is the ire of a group that’s tired of saying &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I told you so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br
                /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This is by far the best produced record of their trilogy, with beats that
                find new and interesting ways to wreak havoc. “Call Ticketron” turns automated ticketing technology into
                a beacon for alien transmissions. On “Hey Kids (Bumaye)” crackling static and thumping bass crater open
                to reveal whirring, wobbling tones and ghostly whispers, and Danny Brown slots in an exceptional guest
                verse. On “Panther Like a Panther (Miracle Mix),” furnished by the shouts of Miami rap goddess Trina,
                rounded blips mimic the patter of hand drums before bursting into a wave of buzzing, distorted noise
                that slowly dissipates back into nothing. They’re still clearly having fun doing this and it’s still fun
                to listen to them work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;It isn’t quite as punchy as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;RTJ2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, which
                was brutish in its tactics, with nonstop bangs and thrills, but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;RTJ3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is a
                triumph in its own right that somehow celebrates the success of a seemingly unlikely friendship and
                mourns the collapse of a nation all at once. “Thieves! (Screamed the Ghost),” a song about riots as a
                response to violence as opposed to a means to create it, samples an iconic Martin Luther King, Jr. quote
                from the 1967 speech “The Other America”: “A riot is the language of the unheard.” In keeping with that
                idea, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;RTJ3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is a soundtrack for the riots to come.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Kate Bush: Before the Dawn</title>
            <link>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22467-before-the-dawn/</link>
            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/617-kate-bush/"&gt;Kate Bush&lt;/a&gt; always
                exploited technological advancement. In 1979, from just coathangers and Blu-Tack, the trailblazing
                British pop auteur pioneered the head mic for her vanguard Tour of Life. Her subsequent albums made her
                one of the earliest adopters of the Fairlight synthesizer that would define the ’80s. &lt;i&gt;Before
                the Dawn&lt;/i&gt;, then, is a surprising throwback: the unexpurgated live album, a document of her 2014
                live shows, her first in 35 years. There are no retakes or overdubs bar a few atmospheric FX. No apps,
                no virtual reality, no interactivity. She’s also said there won’t be a DVD, which is surprising given
                the show’s spectacular theatrics, conceived by the former artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare
                Company and a host of designers, puppeteers, and illusionists. The show, and this release, aren’t
                credited to Kate Bush but the KT Fellowship, in recognition of the vast ensemble effort. Yet in shucking
                off half the production, this hefty 155-minute, three-disc set (one per “act”) is also the best way that
                &lt;i&gt;Before the Dawn&lt;/i&gt; could have been preserved, allowing it to tell its own story
                uninhibited by the busy staging.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;I went to a show towards the end of the 22-date run, and was overwhelmed by how physically
                moving it was to see Bush in real life, since for most of mine she’s only existed in videos and BBC
                clip-show documentaries. The staging didn’t always have the same impact. The sublime Act One, as close
                to a greatest hits as we got, was stripped back—just Bush at the piano backed by her crack band.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In Act Two, Bush realized her long-held desire to dramatize “The Ninth Wave,” the conceptual
                B-side of 1985’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21964-hounds-of-love/"&gt;Hounds
                of Love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, which documents a woman’s dark night of the soul as she fights for life
                while lost at sea. While her “husband” and real-life son Bertie McIntosh blithely carried on with
                domestic life inside a tiny, sloping living room set, a video depicted Bush stranded in dark, choppy
                waters (now released as the &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/news/69894-watch-kate-bushs-new-video-for-and-dream-of-sheep/"&gt;“And Dream
                of Sheep” video&lt;/a&gt;). Moments later, the real Bush reappeared on stage to fight sinister “fish
                people” who carried her body off through the aisles. The whirring blades and desperate search lights of
                a rescue helicopter descended from the Hammersmith Apollo’s ceiling, illuminating and buffeting the
                crowd. Despite some hammy dialogue, it was staggering, and in sharp contrast to Act Three, which focused
                on &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1181-aerial/"&gt;Aerial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;’s
                second side, “A Sky of Honey.” McIntosh played a landscape painter from ye olden times while a life-size
                marionette of a jointed-doll simpered around the stage, embracing Bush, who looked on in raptures. At 75
                minutes long, it was a sickly, trying accompaniment to one of the subtler achievements in her catalogue.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;With the visuals stripped away, some confusing vestiges of the live show remain on the
                record—mostly the stilted dialogue (McIntosh’s lines as the painter are cringeworthy). But otherwise it
                flows remarkably well: the prog grooves and piano ballads of the first act setting up the gothic tumult
                of “The Ninth Wave,” which comes down into the sun-dappled ambience of “A Sky of Honey.” The sound is
                rich and warm, but rough, too: imperfectly mic’d and properly live-sounding. The arrangements are
                largely faithful, even down to the synth presets, though sometimes the veteran session musicians form an
                overwhelming battalion. “Lily” comes out sounding a bit like Christian goth rock, and “King of the
                Mountain” is a victim of breadth over depth, its dynamics drowned out by every band member playing at
                once. It’s a shame that the terror of “Hounds of Love” gets swapped for sentimental optimism, but the
                band recreate that album’s second half to sound as avant-garde and bracing as any current young
                outsider.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Live albums are meant to capture performers at their rawest and least inhibited, which doesn’t
                really apply to &lt;i&gt;Before the Dawn&lt;/i&gt;. Bush is a noted perfectionist best known for her
                synthesizer experiments and love of obscure Bulgarian choirs, but her recent work has skewed towards
                traditional setups that reunite her with the prog community that fostered her early career. With marks
                to hit and tableaux to paint, the 2014 shows were more &lt;i&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/i&gt; (or an
                extension of 2011’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15448-directors-cut/"&gt;Director’s
                Cut&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) than &lt;i&gt;Live at Leeds&lt;/i&gt;. But never mind balls-out revamps of
                Bush’s best known songs; with the exception of tracks from &lt;i&gt;Hounds of Love&lt;/i&gt;, none of
                the rest of the setlist had ever been done live—not even on TV, which became Bush’s primary stage after
                she initially retired from touring. These songs weren’t written to be performed, but internalized.
                Occupying Bush’s imagination for an hour, and letting it fuse with your own, formed the entirety of the
                experience. Hearing this aspic-preserved material come to life feels like going to sleep and waking up
                decades later to see how the world has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;“Jig of Life” is the midpoint of &lt;i&gt;Before the Dawn&lt;/i&gt;, and its crux. It forms the
                part in “The Ninth Wave” where Bush’s character is exhausted of fighting against drowning, and decides
                to succumb to death. A vision of her future self appears, and convinces her to stay alive. “Now is the
                place where the crossroads meet,” she chants, just as her (then) 56-year-old voice channels her
                27-year-old one. Despite her alleged taste for burning one, Bush’s voice has gained in power rather than
                faded with age. It’s deeper now, and some of the songs’ keys shift to match, but it’s alive and
                incalculably moving, still capable of agile whoops and tender eroticism, and possesses a newfound
                authority. When she roars lustily through opener “Lily” and its declaration that “life has blown a great
                big hole through me,” she sets up the stakes of &lt;i&gt;Before the Dawn&lt;/i&gt;’s quest for peace. In
                Act One, she’s running from the prospect of love on “Hounds of Love” and “Never Be Mine,” and from fame
                on “King of the Mountain,” where she searches for Elvis with sensual anticipation. She asks for Joan of
                Arc’s protection on “Joanni,” matching the French visionary’s fearlessness with her own funky diva roar,
                and sounds as if she could raze the world as she looks down from “Top of the City.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Rather than deliver a copper-bottomed greatest hits set, Bush reckons with her legacy through
                what might initially seem like an obscure choice of material. Both Acts Two and Three take place in
                transcendent thresholds: “The Ninth Wave”’s drowning woman is beset by anxiety and untold pressures,
                with no idea of where to turn, mirroring the limbo that Bush experienced after 1982’s &lt;i&gt;The
                Dreaming&lt;/i&gt;. That suite’s last song, the cheery “The Morning Fog,” transitions into &lt;i&gt;Aerial&lt;/i&gt;’s
                “Prelude,” all beatific bird call and dawn-light piano. The euphoric, tender “A Sky of Honey” is meant
                to represent a perfect day from start to finish, filled with family and beautiful imperfections.
                “Somewhere in Between” finds them atop “the highest hill,” looking out onto a stilling view, and Bush’s
                eerie jazz ensemble anticipates the liminal peace of &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"&gt;Bowie&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21332-blackstar/"&gt;Blackstar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. “Not one
                of us would dare to break the silence,” she sings. “Oh how we have longed for something that would make
                us feel so… somewhere in between.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Purgatory has become heaven, and in the narrative Bush constructs through her setlist, “A Sky
                of Honey” represents the grown-up, domestic happiness that staves off the youthful fears explored on
                &lt;i&gt;Hounds of Love&lt;/i&gt;. For her final song, she closes with a rendition of “Cloudbusting,” a
                song about living with the memory of a forbidden love, which is even more glorious for all the hope that
                it’s accumulated in the past 30-odd years. Bush’s recent life as a “reclusive” mother is often used to
                undermine her, to “prove” she was the kook that sexist critics had pegged her as all along. These
                performances and this record are a generous reveal of why she’s chosen to retreat, where Bush shows she
                won’t disturb her hard-won peace to sustain the myth of the troubled artistic genius. Between the
                dangerous waters of “The Ninth Wave” and the celestial heavens of “A Sky of Honey,” &lt;i&gt;Before the
                Dawn&lt;/i&gt; demystifies what we’ve fetishized in her absence. Without draining her magic, it lets
                Bush exist back down on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Since their 1990 debut, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21218-peoples-instinctive-travels-and-the-paths-of-rhythm/"&gt;People’s
                Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6195-a-tribe-called-quest/"&gt;A Tribe Called Quest&lt;/a&gt;
                have been forward-thinking, presenting their albums as full-length meditations on sound and society.
                They didn’t break new ground as much as they dug deeper into the lands beneath their feet, turning
                stones and cultivating fertile soil, unearthing the past and tending the roots, with album-length suites
                centered around loose conceits—the light diary of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;Instinctive Travels, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;the aural
                dive into drums, bass, and downbeats of 1991’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The
                Low End Theory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, the pan-African flight of
                1993’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Midnight Marauders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, the dysfunction of hip-hop’s materialism on 1996’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Beats, Rhymes and Life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;, and the yearning sadness of 1998’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The
                Love Movement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. The latter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; strived to serve as a healing elixir and balm for what was, up until
                recently, the swan song for one of the greatest acts that hip-hop has ever produced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Alluded to constantly via rumors and unfounded hopes, a
                forthcoming Tribe album seemed like wishful thinking for years. Despite &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/news/67671-la-reid-says-new-a-tribe-called-quest-album-will-be-released/"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;the assurances of legendary music executives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, fans could not be blamed for being cynical. The group had splintered
                fabulously, as documented in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Michael Rapaport’s
                unflinching 2011 documentary &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Beats, Rhymes
                &amp;amp; Life: The Travels of a Tribe Called Quest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;. Moreover, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/news/64339-a-tribe-called-quests-phife-dawg-dead-at-45/"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;the death of member Malik “Phife Dawg” Taylor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; earlier this year, seemed to ensure that any future efforts would be full
                of excavated throwaways and repurposed vocals from other projects made fresh via studio magic. Yet, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;We got it from Here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt; exists, their sixth (and final) album, and it’s full of unblemished offerings that were
                recorded at &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3499-q-tip/"&gt;Q-Tip&lt;/a&gt;’s home studio
                following their performance on Jimmy Fallon’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The
                Tonight Show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; one year ago. And, against
                many odds, it’s an album that reinvigorates the group’s enviable discography without resting on the
                nostalgia of past accomplishment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The album’s first number, “The Space Program,” is
                quintessential Tribe—it has that sooty bottom heavy warmness, the uncluttered arrangements and bright
                instrumentation, and it sounds like a piece of 2016 instead of a fragment of 1994. For the first time in
                their career, the entire group appears to be at their peak, exuding a well-earned effortlessness. Even
                if Ali Shaheed Muhammad is listed nowhere on the credits, the act’s three MC’s—the abstract Q-Tip, the
                ruffneck Phife, and the often M.I.A. Jarobi—are on point all the time, picking up each other's couplets
                and passing microphones like hot potatoes. On “The Space Program,” Jarobi rhymes “We takin’ off to Mars,
                got the space vessels overflowin’/What, you think they want us there? All us niggas not goin’,” before
                Q-Tip nimbly takes over with “Reputation ain’t glowin’, reparations ain’t flowin’/If you find yourself
                stuck in a creek, you better start rowin’.” The song plays with a sci-fi framing—“There ain't no space
                program for niggas/Yo, you stuck here, nigga”—yet it’s not about an imaginary future, but right now.
                “Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude,” Q-Tip raps, unveiling the entire song as a
                metaphor for gentrification, perhaps even forecasting the showdown over &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a

                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. And just that quickly, you realize that Tribe—poetical, allegorical,
                direct, and forever pushing forward from the present—are back as if they never left. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The timeliness of this album can’t be understated, nor
                could it have been predicted. On &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18610-a-tribe-called-quest-we-the-people/"&gt;We the People…&lt;/a&gt;,”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Q-Tip breaks out into a mini-song as hook: “All you Black folks, you must
                go/All you Mexicans, you must go/And all you poor folks, you must go/Muslims and gays, boy we hate your
                ways/So all you bad folk, you must go.” It follows in the pathways of &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/33738-jamila-woods/"&gt;Jamila Woods&lt;/a&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22156-heavn/"&gt;HEAVN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/26010-solange/"&gt;Solange
                Knowles&lt;/a&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22482-a-seat-at-the-table/"&gt;A
                Seat at the Table&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;as
                an album that expresses the deeply painful and deep-seated racist attitudes of current America without
                rancor. That the hook echoes President-elect Donald Trump’s most famous and reductionist campaign views
                works in ways that it would not had Hillary Clinton garnered enough electoral college votes to win the
                election. (For comparison, the video for &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31519-ty-dolla-ign/"&gt;Ty
                Dolla $ign&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"&gt;Future&lt;/a&gt;’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a

                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; released the day
                before the election, seemed to bank on a Clinton victory in its jubilation, but now feels tone deaf.)
                Ironically, Tribe may have also been seeing a Clinton victory; Q-Tip references a female president on
                “The Space Program.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A decade and a half ago, while working on his
                (erroneously shelved, then belatedly released) sophomore album &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13471-kamaal-the-abstract/"&gt;Kamaal the Abstract&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, Q-Tip was asked about grown men making hip-hop music—he had, after all,
                just entered his thirties and was still playing at what is largely a young person’s game. He countered
                that hip-hop was not solely a youth genre; that the media and commercial forces had made it so; that the
                top MC of the moment—&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"&gt;Jay Z&lt;/a&gt;—was in his
                thirties; that the best art comes not from the exuberance of youth, but the mastery of form. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;We got it from Here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt; proves that he was right. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Q-Tip has long been quietly regarded as one of hip-hop’s
                most thoughtful and inventive producers, and this album is full of accomplished flourishes. On the
                lascivious “Enough!!,” the vocals of Ms Jck (of undersung alt-R&amp;amp;B progenitors J*Davey) are
                treated like source material, woven into the musical bed. There are layered, echoing, melodic sonic
                manipulations and restrained uses of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4638-jack-white/"&gt;Jack
                White&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/7104-elton-john/"&gt;Elton John&lt;/a&gt;
                on “Solid Wall of Sound.” On the introspective and confessional “Ego,” White (again) is used sparingly
                and smartly for subdued electric guitar touches. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;We got it from Here &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;s not the music of a producer showing off, but of one knowing what to do
                and when to do it. There is a bevy of guests on this record, but they all serve the project like
                instruments that come in and out without attempting to take over with solo turns. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;When “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18608-a-tribe-called-quest-dis-generation/"&gt;Dis Generation&lt;/a&gt;”
                uses a sample of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/23695-musical-youth/"&gt;Musical Youth&lt;/a&gt;’s
                “Pass the Dutchie,” one can see a labyrinth of in-jokes and conceptual easter eggs that extends to the
                rhymes: Phife prefers cabs to Uber; Jarobi is wizened, smoking on “impeccable grass” and waiting for New
                York to approve medical marijuana; and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/514-busta-rhymes/"&gt;Busta
                Rhymes&lt;/a&gt;—who appears multiple times and sounds more at home with his Native Tongues brethren
                than he ever has with the extended Cash Money bling set or even on his&lt;i&gt; &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18840-busta-rhymes-q-tip-the-abstract-and-the-dragon/"&gt;The
                Abstract and the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; mixtape
                with Q-Tip—is “Bruce Lee-in’ niggas while you niggas UFC.” For his part, Q-Tip shouts out &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30517-joey-bada/"&gt;Joey Bada$$&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"&gt;Earl Sweatshirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"&gt;Kendrick Lamar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28309-j-cole/"&gt;J. Cole&lt;/a&gt; as “gatekeepers of flow/They are
                extensions of instinctual soul.” It’s what ATCQ has always been—self-referential without being
                self-serving, part of the pack but moving at their own pace, and able to lightly and relatedly convey
                observations that would be heavy and pedantic from just about anyone else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;It can’t be said enough how simply &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;good&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; this
                record sounds and feels. Everyone here shows themselves to be a better rapper than they have ever been
                before, but that still doesn’t capture the ease and exuberance of it all, how Q-Tip curls flows and
                words on “The Donald,” how Jarobi surprises with packed strings of rhyme at each turn, how Phife and
                Busta Rhymes dip effortlessly in and out of Caribbean patois and Black American slanguage. (And that’s
                not even taking into account &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/921-consequence/"&gt;Consequence&lt;/a&gt;’s
                inventive word marriages on “Mobius” and “Whateva Will Be,” Kendrick Lamar’s energetic angst on “Conrad
                Tokyo,” or &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6335-andre-3000/"&gt;André 3000&lt;/a&gt;’s and
                Tip’s playful tag team on “Kids…”) The music is decidedly analog, a refutation of polished sheen and
                maximal perfection; it’s an extension and culmination of ATCQ’s jazz-influenced low-end theory. But that
                doesn’t capture the bounces, grooves, sexual moans, random bleeps, stuttering drums that float
                throughout—like every classic Tribe album, it defies simple descriptions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Many of the songs here hearken back to off-kilter and
                underexposed gems of days past (see: Tribe’s “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a

                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; with Busta Rhymes and &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1028-de-la-soul/"&gt;De La Soul&lt;/a&gt;’s ATCQ-featuring “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span

                past for musical antecedents) without feeling like retreads, the free-wheeling whimsy and
                experimentation of the past having been replaced a grounded irony and proficiency. So much has stayed
                the same and yet so much has changed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;There’s no overriding story that easily presents
                itself—no vocal guide a la &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Midnight
                Marauders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, no driving ethos served on
                platter like the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Low End Theory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;; the title itself, which lends to an interpretation of this as a project
                of hubris demanding homage, is never explicitly explained. Even Phife’s death is given due reverence,
                but isn’t treated as a central theme. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;We got
                it from Here... Thank You 4 Your service &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;is
                all just beats, rhymes, and life. Nothing about this feels like a legacy cash-in; it feels like a legit
                A Tribe Called Quest album. We should be the ones thanking them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Leonard Cohen: You Want It Darker</title>
            <link>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22514-you-want-it-darker/</link>
            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen/"&gt;Leonard Cohen&lt;/a&gt; has
                been bidding his farewell for decades, since before we ever met him. In 1966, he opened &lt;i&gt;Beautiful
                Losers&lt;/i&gt;—his mystical, lysergic, gleefully obscene second novel—with the sunset plea, “Can I
                love you in my own way? I am an old scholar, better-looking now than when I was young. That’s what
                sitting on your ass does to your face.” He was just 32 then, rakish without ravaging, not yet celebrated
                for pairing wry, elegant sacrilege to folk melodies—a year before courting “Suzanne,” 18 from raising
                his “Hallelujah.” But even then, he was conscious and deferential to the light waning around him.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Which is a placidity his followers don’t always share; what other 82-year-old artist could
                possibly acknowledge his impending mortality and alarm his fans enough to recant? After &lt;i&gt;The New
                Yorker&lt;/i&gt;’s&lt;a
                href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/17/leonard-cohen-makes-it-darker" target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow"&gt; remarkable recent profile&lt;/a&gt; quoted him as “ready to die”—depicting a mentally
                dexterous, physically frail ascetic “confined to barracks” in Los Angeles, solemnly tidying his
                affairs—Cohen took pains to&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/news/69011-leonard-cohen-backtracks-i-intend-to-live-forever/"&gt; console
                his fans&lt;/a&gt;, with familiar drollness: “I’ve always been into self-dramatization. I intend to live
                forever.” But even as he demurs, it’s hard not to play his 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; studio album,
                &lt;i&gt;You Want It Darker,&lt;/i&gt; and hear a pristine, piously crafted last testament—a courtly act
                of finality that extends to the title. (Notice it’s not a question; it’s a prescription.)&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Cohen has always kicked up his heels in the ambiguities of love and spirituality—casting
                prayers to the carnal&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;getting off on enlightenment. And so this new darkness he
                offers has dimensions instead of declaratives—it feels, in turn, to lyrically reference the encroaching
                blackness of death, the insularity of plumbing the soul ever-deeper, a fresh fatalism toward the
                spinning world. “I’m leaving the table/I’m out of the game/I don’t know the people/In your picture
                frame,” he laments, achingly, on “Leaving the Table,” over a warm and minimal waltz. Later, he intones,
                “I’m traveling light/It’s au revoir/My once so bright/My fallen star” (“Traveling Light”). It’s
                delivered with a wink, and no more dramatically brooding than his past work, but it is inescapably
                morbid; every track is vivid yet still enigmatic as it conjures loss and lamentation of some variety.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This darkness also apparent in the newly fathomless boom of his baritone, which already
                stripped the floorboards on recent albums &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16228-leonard-cohen-old-ideas/"&gt;Old Ideas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;
                &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19853-leonard-cohen-popular-problems/"&gt;Popular Problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.
                Whereas the rough edges of his younger, nasal reediness suggested chic bohemian nonchalance, now his low
                caroling is edged in defiance, and &lt;i&gt;Darker&lt;/i&gt;’s production is singularly complementary to
                it. When he imagines, not so subtly, the stars above him losing light (“If I Didn’t Have Your Love”),
                his intoning dips below cherubic organs, hinting at what these enamored lyrics soon reveal—that this
                bright devotional is of the spiritual sort, hewing closer to his past career as a monk than as an
                Olympic-level ladies’ man. (The most jarring thing about &lt;i&gt;Darker&lt;/i&gt; is how utterly devoid
                of lust it is.) The gracious, spare production adds to the spell—contributed by his son, Adam Cohen, who
                almost wholly replaces his father’s proclivities for tinny keyboards and stately, gospel-esque female
                harmonies in favor of violins, warm acoustic guitar, and a cantor male choir. The elder Cohen’s familiar
                scaffolding of flamenco-influenced guitar remains, a bridge to history.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Cohen is not a songwriter who panders; he speaks above us, sometimes quite literally to higher
                forms, but also to universality instead of common denominator. Topicality, to him, remains somewhere
                around the Romantic era. But Cohen is also keen to experiment here. He embraces spry, rootsy bluegrass
                strings on “Steer Your Way,” which nods back in a few directions—to his college stint in a country band,
                to 1971’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11901-songs-of-leonard-cohensongs-from-a-roomsongs-of-love-and-hate/"&gt;Songs
                of Love and Hate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (which featured Charlie Daniels on fiddle), to brighter moments on
                &lt;i&gt;Popular Problems.&lt;/i&gt; The album’s final track, for the first time, is a string reprise;
                it bows out “String Reprise/Treaty,” Cohen’s difficult conversation with his higher power (“I wish there
                was a treaty we could sign/It’s over now, the water and the wine/We were broken then, but now we’re
                borderline”) with delicate, mournful dignity.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The album’s heart is exposed early, and plainly, in the title track. Its religious tones veer
                toward disdainful (“If you are the dealer/I’m out of the game/If you are the healer/I’m broken and
                lame”) but his oaky growl quickly becomes rapturous. Three times, as the choir drops out, he chants,
                “Hineni Hineni”—a Hebrew cry of devotion, the reply of a ready worshipper who hears their calling from
                God and is ready to act in service. Often, it’s the service in the afterlife. His is not a yelp of
                fervor, or excitable in any shade; the moment is his most quaking, sunken baritone delivery on the
                album—so deep, it would sound sinister without such compassion imbuing it. It’s the informed conclusion
                of a lifetime of inquiry. Hopefully, it is one holy dialogue of more still to come. But in this moment,
                he sounds satisfied; he has loved us in his own way, and he is ready for what awaits him next. But that
                doesn’t mean we are.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Weyes Blood: Front Row Seat to Earth</title>
            <link>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22463-front-row-seat-to-earth/</link>
            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/32440-weyes-blood/"&gt;Weyes Blood&lt;/a&gt; makes serious music, but
                she doesn’t take herself too seriously. Proof of that can be found in the final seconds of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Front Row Seat to Earth,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt; the fourth full-length from the singer/songwriter/producer born Natalie Mering. A brass band
                breaks through the din of hazy film samples and warped classical piano with the kind of royal
                proclamation that declares, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I’m here!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—just as the soiree is ending. Oops! Or look to the album’s cover. The
                scene—a river winding through a dystopian landscape, with Mering perched on her side in the middle of it
                all, clad in a stylish turquoise satin suit—is mesmerizing. Then the eye moves towards her shoes:
                beat-up sneakers. What the hell?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Front Row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; works sort of similarly. The songs overflow with tender harmonies worthy
                of a Roches record and ornate instrumentation (from Mering and a strong cast of contributors) that
                blends ’70s AM radio, the psychier end of late ’60s folk, and touches of Celtic and Renaissance music.
                But listen closer and there's often a slightly alien (and typically electronic) undercurrent that keeps
                you intrigued. It’s there in the ominous synth line that rises up from below a peaceful acoustic and
                tasteful woodblock and shakers in “Away Above,” and again in the deadpan background vocals that haunt “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18482-weyes-blood-seven-words/"&gt;Seven Words&lt;/a&gt;” just
                below the surface of a doe-eyed slide guitar solo from Hand Habits’ Meg Duffy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The over-the-top pinnacle of this effect comes on the
                knockout six-and-a-half-minute single “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18516-weyes-blood-do-you-need-my-love/"&gt;Do You Need My Love&lt;/a&gt;,”
                where Mering sustains a note—on the word “need”—intermittently in the song’s last half. All around her
                calm belt, calamity stirs: a brass band, piano chords, a thick bassline, graceful and complex
                percussion, and above all, an ominous synth that glows like an orb, brighter and brighter to the end.
                Keep in mind, this is a song that two minutes earlier, featured a breakdown comprised of psychedelic
                organ and thunder noises, which sounds like an oddly specific combination to anyone who hasn’t endured
                the &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5036-the-doors/"&gt;Doors&lt;/a&gt;. At times Mering really
                does sound like “&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1353-enya/"&gt;Enya&lt;/a&gt; Does the Lost
                Songs of Karen Carpenter (Backed by &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/14472-ray-manzarek/"&gt;Ray
                Manzarek&lt;/a&gt;).” But thankfully her lyrics don’t also lose themselves in mystical platitudes
                borrowed from generations past. She cuts through the bullshit here: “&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Do
                you need &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;someone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;” she
                asks, walking the line between robotic and serene. “&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Do you need
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;love?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As much of a throwback as Mering can seem, at her best
                she captures her era in her words. On “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18565-weyes-blood-generation-why/"&gt;Generation Why&lt;/a&gt;,”
                arguably the album’s centerpiece, she actually sings the letters “YOLO” with more thoughtful care than
                the phrase ever deserved. Using the kind of dulcet finger-picking and flowery folk-singer phrasing
                that’s been easy to dismiss as wimpy for decades, Mering essentially chronicles how she learned to stop
                worrying and love the bomb. “I’ve been hanging/On my phone all day/And the fear goes away,” she says,
                trying to embrace the kids’ distraction of choice from the coming end times. Later, she surmises, almost
                kicking herself halfway through for jinxing it, “It’s not the past/That scares me/Now what a great
                future/This is gonna be.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Even Mering’s less philosophical takes feel distinctly
                modern. “Be Free,” the song that sounds the most like a waltz, finds her embracing an independent
                approach to drifting apart that seems more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
                now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; than of the free love era its far-out
                sounds might have worked within. “It’s just the two of us/And I want you to be free/Don’t worry about
                me/I got my thing,” she sings. As first she sounds perfectly clear (the record’s production is
                excellent), but by the end, in creep those alien background vocals again. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;It’s this ability—to twist an homage just enough to show
                that you’re aware of how totally saccharine it sounds—that makes Mering shine in a way she hasn’t on her
                albums up to this point. She commits more fully to the world she’s building here, though 2014’s
                sprawling rock rumination &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19792-weyes-blood-the-innocents/"&gt;The Innocents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;is not
                without its highlights. Her approach (not her sound) recalls &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/33946-angelo-badalamenti/"&gt;Angelo Badalamenti&lt;/a&gt;’s lush,
                over-the-top score to “Twin Peaks.” It was overwhelming and kitschy, but you could tell that he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;knew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; it,
                particularly when paired with &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5816-david-lynch/"&gt;David Lynch&lt;/a&gt;’s
                work. Mering’s music might sound like it belongs from a bygone era, but she definitely &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;knows &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;it. If
                you listen closely enough, you can start to locate her in this fantastical backdrop—sly and assured.
                What, doesn’t everyone wear sneakers to the apocalypse?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;Imagine it: You grew up in Oxnard, Calif. Your dad went to prison for beating your mom. You had
                a kid with your second wife. You lost your job, and a place to live. You were homeless.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Your friends looked out for you. You slowly picked yourself up. You changed your name: Breezy
                Lovejoy became &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/33213-andersonpaak/"&gt;Anderson .Paak&lt;/a&gt;.
                You gained &lt;a
                href="https://medium.com/cuepoint/anderson-paak-how-i-landed-in-the-studio-with-dr-dre-and-dj-premier-f65a1a2c0a33#.e2x9pnhou"
                target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;some traction&lt;/a&gt;, partly by redoubling your &lt;a
                href="http://pigeonsandplanes.com/in-depth/2015/09/anderson-paak-interview" target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow"&gt;focus on your vocals&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the beatmaking to producers you trusted. Some
                Soundcloud hits followed, some friendships with well-connected rappers, a sophomore album, &lt;i&gt;Venice&lt;/i&gt;,
                on which your voice had gone from a blunt instrument to a swiss army knife, able to do 15 different
                things at once.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;And then you got the call. From Aftermath, &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"&gt;Dr. Dre&lt;/a&gt;’s label. A representative was
                checking to see if you were interested in the American dream, California rap edition—in working with an
                icon you’d been listening to since &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9827-anderson-paak-and-the-power-of-positive-rb/"&gt;you were
                six years old&lt;/a&gt;. You made it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Channel that experience, .Paak’s own recent past, into a single song, and you might come up
                with something like “Livvin,” the first proper song off &lt;i&gt;Yes Lawd!&lt;/i&gt;, his new joint
                album with the beatmaker &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/32885-knxwledge/"&gt;Knxwledge&lt;/a&gt;.
                “Livvin” is triumph incarnate, a new entry in the tradition of “ashy-to-classy” tracks like “Juicy” and
                “Touch the Sky.” .Paak preaches the gospel of success in between rolling drums, mellow horns, and a
                church choir. His voice’s inextricability from the music is a testament to his chemistry with a producer
                steeped in the tradition of the beat scene godheads, &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"&gt;Dilla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"&gt;Madlib&lt;/a&gt;. (.Paak and Knx, whose real name is
                Glen Boothe, have merged their names into &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/33952-nxworries/"&gt;NxWorries&lt;/a&gt;,
                an apparent nod to the definitive Stones Throw duos, &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2230-jaylib/"&gt;Jaylib&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2909-madvillain/"&gt;Madvillain&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;.Paak’s sudden stardom, largely due to his work with Dre and to this year’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21387-malibu/"&gt;Malibu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, his
                extraordinary third album, might tempt listeners to give him the credit for &lt;i&gt;Yes Lawd!&lt;/i&gt;’s
                many successes. But the record, which includes tracks recorded between early 2015 and March 2016, is
                first and foremost a beat tape, stacked with beautiful little donuts, most of which don’t pass the
                three-minute mark. Knx was &lt;a
                href="http://larecord.com/archive/2015/05/05/knxwledge-interview-hud-dreems" target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow"&gt;raised on church music, hip-hop radio, and J Dilla&lt;/a&gt;, and the rich
                instrumentals here are loaded with tributes to all three. “Sidepiece” offers .Paak a chance to sing the
                lyrics of “Won’t Do” from Dilla’s posthumous album &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9335-the-shining/"&gt;The Shining&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;: “One
                won’t do and two is not enough for me, no,” while “Can’t Stop” is a zoned-out moment of musical reverie
                that intimately recalls Jay Dee. The beats are the soul of the album, and .Paak serves as a faithful
                instrument, the organ at their core.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Producers have fallen hard for .Paak and here, he shows several reasons why his stock has risen
                so quickly. He’s uniquely aware of the flexibility of his voice as an instrument and is one of the more
                emotive rappers I can remember hearing, on a level with &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1120-dmx/"&gt;DMX&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"&gt;Young Thug&lt;/a&gt;. On “Best One,” even as he
                expresses gratitude for a woman who’s taken him in, you can hear urgency, and empathy, in his voice:
                “You know I could be leaving in a moment’s notice/You telling me to stay to the morning/You know a nigga
                homeless.” On “&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18532-nxworries-lyk-dis/"&gt;Lyk Dis&lt;/a&gt;,”
                he channels no one so much as &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/537-erykah-badu/"&gt;Erykah Badu&lt;/a&gt;,
                riding the beat with gravelly, percussive verses delivered in short bursts.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the past, Knxwledge has had trouble focusing on a particular sound for too long, but it’s
                his focus that holds the record together through 19 tracks, even as he shows off his range. On “What
                More Can I Say,” one of the prettiest songs here, mournful violin strings engage in a duet with a quiet
                bass rumble, and their interchange makes for some of the most moving music on the album, particularly
                when the horns arrive. (If you pride yourself on recognizing samples, this album will offer up a form of
                exquisite torture at least a couple of times, as you attempt to track down lovely little fragments.) The
                shuffling beat on “Link Up” is one of the more subtle offerings here, but its winding rhythms and muted
                sample make .Paak sound as if he’s singing from the middle of the dancefloor, appropriate for a song
                about nocturnal pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Many of .Paak’s songs are about going out, and particularly about women, and it’s in their
                lyrics that &lt;i&gt;Yes Lawd!&lt;/i&gt; reveals one of its only issues, a lack of lyrical substance.
                While an artist like &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"&gt;Drake&lt;/a&gt;
                comfortably straddles the line between rapper and R&amp;amp;B singer, .Paak is more of a crooner than a
                rhymer. There are too few moments like the clever little lyrical elaboration on “Best One”: “I could
                leave it at a drop of a fedora/But damn it girl I want you.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;And what we get instead can be ugly. On “Livvin,” .Paak sings about the feeling of ascending
                the ladder, but on some songs, it seems like he’s pulling it up behind him. The sentiment toward other
                strivers on “H.A.N.” is stingy, and .Paak’s portraits of his relationships are often shallow—a fact that
                the final track “Fkku” seems to acknowledge, giving a woman’s voice the record’s final kiss-off. The
                worrisome thing here is not that .Paak can be sexist. It’s that there’s nothing to counter or
                contextualize his attitude. On “Suede,” .Paak makes an explicit effort to justify the slurs he
                frequently uses: “If I call you a bitch/It’s cause you’re my bitch/And as long as no one else call you a
                bitch/Then there won’t be no problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The records that .Paak and Boothe admire, the classic Stones Throw collaborations, found two
                artists working at the absolute height of their talents. &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5579-madvillainy/"&gt;Madvillainy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, in
                particular, was a perfect match between an internal rhyme genius in Doom and a beatmaking savant in
                Madlib. That album, released in 2004, remains a high water mark in Stones Throw’s history. .Paak and Knx
                are both so talented that it seems fair to hold them to that standard. And what’s astonishing here is
                the way they manage to forge a sound nearly as rich and original as that of America’s most blunted. One
                of the few disappointing things about the largely terrific &lt;i&gt;Yes Lawd!&lt;/i&gt; is the way that
                Knx outdoes .Paak, but the rapper/singer is at the beginning of a bright career in which he’s already
                demonstrated his ability to write rich lyrics—this record, which includes some of the most beautiful
                songs he’s made yet, has far more to be proud of than not. It’s another major accomplishment in .Paak’s
                continued rise.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Solange Knowles turned 30 in June, and it seems clear
                that her Saturn Returns manifested in an artistic surge. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A Seat at the Table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;, her third full-length album, is the work of a woman who’s truly grown into herself, and
                discovered within a clear, exhilarating statement of self and community that’s as robust in its quieter
                moments as it is in its funkier ones. Even though it’s been out less than a week, it already seems like
                a document of historical significance, not just for its formidable musical achievements but for the way
                it encapsulates black cultural and social history with such richness, generosity, and truth. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;To this point, Solange has been trying on styles and
                stretching out into her own skills as a songwriter. Having spent her early teen years singing backup and
                writing songs, she debuted as a solo artist at just 16, with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Solo Star&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;.
                Very 2003, it was a gleaming, hip-hop-informed album that slinked over beats from the likes of Timbaland
                and the Neptunes; even with plenty of great tracks, the production outweighed her presence. After a
                five-year break as a solo artist—during which she got married, had son Julez, moved to Idaho, got
                divorced, starred in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Bring It On: All or
                Nothing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, among other films, and wrote songs
                for her sister Beyoncé (whew!)—she returned in 2008 with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. That album was clearly immersed in a deep love of ’60s funk and soul and
                its attendant politics, and she rebelled against expectations (see: “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3unTmWpvio" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Fuck the Industry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;”),
                eager to fully express her individuality. She fused her musical impulses in the easy, ebullient grooves
                of 2012’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; EP, which eased a glossier vision of pop into the soulfunk groove she had
                ingrained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Even with such an impressive resume, though, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A Seat at the Table &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;is on a different plane. It’s a document of the struggle of a black woman, and black women, in
                2016, as Solange confronts painful indignities and situates them historically. Many of these songs draw
                from current reactions to the seemingly unending killing of black women and men at the hands of the
                police, but the scope of the record as a whole is much larger than that, with Civil Rights hymnals
                encompassing centuries of horror black Americans have been subject to, including that inflicted on
                Knowles’ own ancestors. But even when Solange offers her narrative in first-person and incorporates her
                family’s past through interludes with her mother Tina and father Mathew, she does so with such artistic
                and emotional openness that this album feels like nothing but a salve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The quick sketch “Rise” opens slowly, on a sweet piano
                and with layers of Solange’s voice in jazz modulations, as a sort of blessing and a placid encouragement
                to thrive despite it all. “Fall in your ways, so you can crumble,” she sings. “Fall in your ways, so you
                can wake up and rise.” The word “rise” lands on the high note, but the song lays out the album’s central
                tension between pain, pride, sorrow, and fierce dignity. This leads directly into “Weary,” a ginger,
                breathy document of exhaustion, and the deceptively euphoric “Cranes in the Sky,” which, taken as a
                “Weary”’s counterpart, illustrates two stages of sorrow. What’s so touching about “Cranes,”
                though—intertwined with the airy, peaceful beauty &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/news/68657-solange-shares-videos-for-new-songs-dont-touch-my-hair-cranes-in-the-sky-watch/"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;of its video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;—is
                the way Solange specifically documents her process of coping, down to the smallest escape mechanisms. On
                a warm bass strut, she sings about drinking, sexing, running, and spending in an effort to be free from
                “those metal clouds,” making visible the kinds of mundane things we all do in the service of a temporary
                reprieve. Naming these actions feels radical in and of itself, but by the time she flies off her own
                cloud of a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE0pwJ5PMDg" target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Minnie Riperton-level&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; aria, she seems to have freed herself from the routine, and transcended
                it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Solange &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://saintheron.com/featured/a-seat-with-us-a-conversation-between-solange-knowles-mrs-tina-lawson-judnick-mayard/"
                target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;has said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; that it was important to her to articulate her roots, and so along with
                the recordings of her parents, she made the bulk of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;A Seat at the Table &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;in New Iberia,
                Louisiana, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;based on that area being the start of
                everything within our family’s lineage,” the place where Tina Knowles-Lawson’s parents first met and
                then fled after being “run out of town.” In terms of production, her song structures, and melodies, she
                celebrates the whole history of black music. But the result is never derivative; when you recognize the
                spirits of artists like Riperton, Zapp, Angie Stone, Aaliyah (lyrically, in “Borderline (An Ode to Self
                Care”), Janet Jackson, Stanley Clarke, Lil Mo, Herbie freakin’ Hancock and so many more, it feels more
                like a musical nod or a wink. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The master musician and bandleader &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Raphael Saadiq serves as co-producer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;; Saadiq meets Solange in the juiciest middle, both bridging their
                instincts between classic instrumentation and futuristic funk. The arrangements are voluminous, loose
                and tight at once, but Solange’s voice is always at the front of this proscenium; each shows restraint
                as they lean into her collective vision. The sound they conjure is chill-inducing, an easy sound for
                subject matter that’s as real and tough as it gets. The excellent “Don’t Touch My Hair” (with a feature
                by Sampha) and “Mad” (her &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfaISz7ntLQ"
                target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;second collaboration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; with Lil Wayne) specifically address the way black women are devalued, and
                the songs meet that with resistance.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Solange’s voice
                is a palliative for the pain she describes, as she names truths to divest them of their power. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A Seat at the Table &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;offers a hearth to black women as much as it asserts Solange’s right to
                comfort and understanding. And in terms of her lived experience, the table of the album’s title,
                metaphysical and physical, rests in her home of New Orleans. In several interludes, the rapper, label
                head, and entrepreneur Master P threads the album with musings on No Limit’s runaway success as a
                black-owned record label (landed him on the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Forbes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; list, baby). That particular segment leads into “F.U.B.U.” ("For Us, By
                Us"), a honey-dripped slow-grinder of black affirmation, with tubas that sound inspired by NOLA’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://www.wwoz.org/programs/inthestreet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Second Lines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
                as Solange mews, “This shit is for us/Don’t try to come for us.” Her sumptuous harmonies build a
                protective forcefield: “Some shit,” she sings, “you can’t touch.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A Seat at the Table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;’s nature is beneficent, but at its spiritual core it is an ode to black
                women and their healing and sustenance in particular; in writing about herself, Solange turns the mirror
                back upon them, and crystallizes the kinship therein. She harmonizes with Kelly Rowland and Nia Andrews
                that “I got so much magic, you can have it,” but the song that perhaps best encapsulates this
                outstanding work is “Scales,” a slow-burning duet with Kelela near the end of the album. Their harmonies
                are heavenly and create almost a meditative effect, a mantra of healing kindness in a syrup-slow synth
                progression. It’s a sex jam, I think, but it can also serve as a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://shine-theory.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;shine-theory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; jam. “You’re a
                superstar,” they sing together, letting the “star” part roll around a bit in the lower part of the
                vibrato. “You’re a superstar.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Jenny Hval: Blood Bitch</title>
            <link>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22314-blood-bitch/</link>
            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;When the feminist artist Judy Chicago showed her painting &lt;i&gt;Red Flag&lt;/i&gt; in 1971,
                she set the precedent for a subject of art that now has a rich lineage: menstrual blood. &lt;i&gt;Red
                Flag&lt;/i&gt; was a photolithograph that closely depicted a woman removing a used tampon from her
                vagina. At the time, moon-cycles were so hushed and taboo that Chicago said many people had no idea what
                they were seeing. Period art has since taken many forms. The disarray of Tracey Emin’s 1998 “My Bed”
                installation included stained underwear. The 13 abstract canvases of Lani Beloso’s 2010 “Period Piece”
                were thickly painted with her own blood. And let us not forget, more recently, the punk singer Meredith
                Graves mixing her blood into the vinyl of &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31732-perfect-pussy/"&gt;Perfect
                Pussy&lt;/a&gt;’s debut record. In 2000, the artist Vanessa Tiegs coined a term for this field:
                menstrala.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There is a long history of abject art that makes use of corporeal waste. Julia Kristeva
                articulated this in her book &lt;i&gt;Powers of Horror&lt;/i&gt;: “These body fluids, this defilement,
                this shit are what life withstands... on the part of death,” Kristeva wrote. “There, I am at the border
                of my condition as a living being.” But period blood is different. According to Kristeva, it “threatens
                the relationship between the sexes” because it “signifies sexual difference.” And so, in threatening
                men, the stigmas surrounding menstrala have not waned. This year, the artist Rupi Kaur posted on
                Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.rupikaur.com/period/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
                data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=https://www.rupikaur.com/period/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1475260151695000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEXiF3XAhi-2g86eNtvoTWQ9bhuWA"&gt;a
                poised self-portrait&lt;/a&gt; with a central red stain—and it was twice removed, “accidentally.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Norwegian avant-gardist &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31232-jenny-hval/"&gt;Jenny
                Hval&lt;/a&gt; takes on the possibilities of musical menstrala with &lt;i&gt;Blood Bitch&lt;/i&gt;. In
                an artist’s statement, she called &lt;i&gt;Blood Bitch&lt;/i&gt; “an investigation of... blood that is
                shed naturally... the purest and most powerful, yet most trivial, and most terrifying blood.” With that,
                &lt;i&gt;Blood Bitch&lt;/i&gt;, her sixth album, deliberately enters two other great traditions: vampire
                movies and—as with all of Hval’s work—the timeless cross-hairs of art and pop.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;No contemporary artist sings words like “sublimation,” “clitoris,” or “soft dick rock” with
                such enveloping elegance or unfettered ease. On &lt;i&gt;Blood Bitch,&lt;/i&gt; Hval continues with her
                subtle deliveries of “abstract romanticism,” “subjectivity,” and “speculum.” Her voice is at once
                extremely musical and coolly flat; occasionally, she whispers. On “The Great Undressing,” even as Hval
                makes a cogent metaphor between capitalism and unrequited love (“it never rests”), the yearning in her
                voice recalls &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"&gt;Lana Del Rey&lt;/a&gt;.
                (In 2015, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/7ltZlJjOJ6/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;at
                least once&lt;/a&gt;, Hval’s touring troupe of singers, dancers, and performance artists did an unusual
                cover of “Summertime Sadness” that I will not forget.) Hval’s “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18525-jenny-hval-period-piece/"&gt;Period Piece&lt;/a&gt;”
                weaves melodies like gorgeous latticework as she describes a sterile scene in a gynecologist’s office
                but turns it into her own personally transcendent experience. “Don’t be afraid,” she beckons, “it’s only
                blood.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Collaborating again with noise producer &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31841-lasse-marhaug/"&gt;Lasse Marhaug&lt;/a&gt;, as on 2015’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20638-apocalypse-girl/"&gt;Apocalypse, girl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,
                Hval was drawn to reflect on her roots in Norwegian metal (in interviews, the duo have even noted ties
                between &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1274-darkthrone/"&gt;Darkthrone&lt;/a&gt;’s black metal
                classic “Transilvanian Hunger” and &lt;i&gt;Blood Bitch&lt;/i&gt;’s lush, rolling penultimate track,
                “Secret Touch”). Though there are patches of harsh noise to be found, &lt;i&gt;Blood Bitch&lt;/i&gt;
                parallels black metal more by its atmospheric nature, how it feels as though the record is thematically
                all-gravity and yet physically floating. The arrangements employ repetition, with recurring motifs and
                menacing synths that move in concentric circles. A subtle siren blare anchors “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18303-jenny-hval-female-vampire/"&gt;Female Vampire&lt;/a&gt;”
                and carries over “In the Red,” replete with the sound of incessant panting, as if someone is running in
                fear. On the former, Hval sings directly of “a strange slow rhythm, not exactly creating a rhythm, in
                and out of focus, vulnerable,” underscoring the nonlinear textures of &lt;i&gt;Blood Bitch&lt;/i&gt;’s
                sound. At its most featherlight, Hval’s music is still positively saturated with ideas, all pulp,
                marrow, and (indeed) blood.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Combined with copious interstitials and its horror premise, &lt;i&gt;Blood Bitch&lt;/i&gt; is
                Hval’s most filmic album (which is saying something considering &lt;i&gt;Apocalypse, girl&lt;/i&gt;
                listed characters from Bergman’s &lt;i&gt;Persona&lt;/i&gt; in the credits) as well as her most
                conceptual and surreal work. It’s also slyly hilarious, adding levity to her repertoire. “The Great
                Undressing” starts with a meta piece in which Hval’s bandmates discuss the record itself—a classic
                expository scene. (Zia Anger: “What’s this album about, Jenny?” Annie Bielski: “It’s about vampires.”
                Anger: “No!” Bielski: “Yeah... Well, it’s about more things than that...”) Hval evokes true modern
                horrors, not just fantastical ones. On “Ritual Awakening,” she sings, “I clutch my phone with my sweaty
                palm,” soon flipping the object as “the coffin for my heart... It’s so loud/And I get so afraid.”
                Machines lock us. Whether it’s Anger deeming vampires “so basic!” or Hval singing of “useless
                algorithms,” &lt;i&gt;Blood Bitch&lt;/i&gt; sounds fiercely present.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blood Bitch&lt;/i&gt; is also more a montage than any of Hval’s records. “Untamed
                Region” includes a sample of the British filmmaker Adam Curtis describing the disorienting power-trip of
                Russian politics: “It sums up the strange mood of our time,” Curtis says alongside choral sighs, “where
                nothing makes any coherent sense.” “Untamed Region” moves into a stately passage in which Hval
                vulnerably and assuredly dissects her own period, touching the blood. More extreme is “The Plague,”
                which goes from tabla taps to a distressed, vampiric Hval summoning skyward, &lt;i&gt;“I don't know who
                I am!” &lt;/i&gt;It’s all cut with horror organs and absurdist dialogue (“Last night I took my birth
                control with rosé!”) before ghastly noise bleeds into a faint dancefloor banger. “The Plague” is like a
                repository of ideas, as if precisely documenting an active mind.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18457-jenny-hval-conceptual-romance/"&gt;Conceptual
                Romance&lt;/a&gt;” is Hval’s best and loveliest song, and its genesis point is clear. Hval has often
                cited Chris Kraus’ 1997 theoretical novel &lt;i&gt;I Love Dick&lt;/i&gt; as her favorite book. &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;The
                text celebrates the interior intellectual life of its narrator, a failed experimental filmmaker, in the
                context of a peculiar love story—she’s become obsessed with a man named Dick and she writes letters to
                him. It began one night, when she believed she had “conceptually fucked” him (through conversation). She
                turns her fixed “infatuation” into an art project. When Hval sings of her “combined failures,” when she
                sings “I understand infatuation/Rejection/They can connect and become everything/Everything that’s torn
                up in your life,” it’s like she is writing her own love letter right back to Kraus (which Hval herself
                affirmed in a recent &lt;i&gt;Wire&lt;/i&gt; feature). Hval said she was inspired by karaoke on &lt;i&gt;Apocalypse,
                girl&lt;/i&gt;, and “Conceptual Romance” could be a result. Her most lucid writing casts the spell of
                dream logic. “Conceptual Romance” is &lt;i&gt;Blood Bitch&lt;/i&gt;’s lightening bolt moment, but it
                throbs with grace, like a procession of clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;“Why do people still not get it when we [women] handle vulnerability like philosophy, at some
                remove?” Kraus writes in &lt;i&gt;I Love Dick&lt;/i&gt;. It’s a fine summation of Hval’s music. More
                than any of the musicians to whom she is often compared (&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/"&gt;Laurie Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"&gt;Björk&lt;/a&gt;), Hval is a clear disciple of Kraus.
                On paper, Kraus moves fluidly from reference to reference, dense with ideas; Hval’s music is like this,
                too, and never more than on &lt;i&gt;Blood Bitch&lt;/i&gt;. Like &lt;i&gt;I Love Dick—&lt;/i&gt;which
                tends to draw lines, life before reading, life after—it is primarily about female genius and voice. “I
                need to keep writing because everything else is death,” Hval sings on “The Great Undressing,” “I’m
                self-sufficient, mad, endlessly producing.” &lt;i&gt;Blood Bitch&lt;/i&gt; conveys the visceral euphoria
                of creation. Blood, it reminds us, is not only a life force—it’s where we begin.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Danny Brown: Atrocity Exhibition</title>
            <link>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22468-atrocity-exhibition/</link>
            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"&gt;Danny Brown&lt;/a&gt; is an
                auteur. Hip-hop has a tradition of collaboration, but the Detroit rapper is a one-man show who, while he
                reps his own Bruiser Brigade and works frequently with a handful of producers, has a voice and vision
                completely his own. You can think of his progression over the last five years in filmic terms. If 2011’s
                &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15753-xxx/"&gt;XXX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; was the
                brilliant independent foreign film that was critically acclaimed and wildly successful and put him on
                the map, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18565-danny-brown-old/"&gt;Old&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
                was the solid but safer domestic version, with higher production costs, a prettier cast, and many of the
                edges sanded off. &lt;i&gt;Atrocity Exhibition&lt;/i&gt;, then, is the movie someone makes after they
                come back down to earth from making that tentpole project, a work predicated on the “one for me, one for
                them” mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Brown’s individual releases need to be understood as part of a whole, and in each of them, he
                has an obsession with form. On &lt;i&gt;Old&lt;/i&gt;, he took a throwaway line about getting jumped on
                the way to the grocery store to buy Wonder Bread from &lt;i&gt;XXX&lt;/i&gt; and built a whole song
                around the incident, and he snakes references to his older work throughout &lt;i&gt;Atrocity Exhibition&lt;/i&gt;.
                Take the title of the first song, “Downward Spiral.” It’s a direct nod to &lt;i&gt;XXX&lt;/i&gt;’s
                opening track, where Brown prominently (and memorably) rapped: “it’s the downward spiral, got me
                suicidal/But too scared to do it.” By reaching back five years, Brown makes &lt;i&gt;Atrocity Exhibition&lt;/i&gt;
                a brick in a larger edifice, perhaps a bookend to an implied trilogy that starts with &lt;i&gt;XXX&lt;/i&gt;
                and ends here.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Structurally, &lt;i&gt;Atrocity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; Exhibition &lt;/i&gt;finds Brown doubling
                down on familiar tropes from his last two records: once again he starts with a gripping opener, the &lt;i&gt;mise-en-scène&lt;/i&gt;;
                following that are some shorter songs in rapid succession that do the dirty work of exposition; a
                back-half run that reckons with the hedonism that comes before it (that section here starts with the
                &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31712-kelela/"&gt;Kelela&lt;/a&gt;-anointed “From the Ground”);
                and then, finally, a stomach-churning closing track that is never triumphantly resolute but feels like
                an ending just the same.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But the references extend well beyond Brown’s own work, and well beyond hip-hop. “Downward
                Spiral” is of course an oblique &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"&gt;Nine
                Inch Nails&lt;/a&gt; nod, and Brown, who sampled &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4216-this-heat/"&gt;This Heat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5395-hawkwind/"&gt;Hawkwind&lt;/a&gt; on the same song on &lt;i&gt;XXX&lt;/i&gt;,
                drags &lt;i&gt;Atrocity Exhibition&lt;/i&gt; through an industrial, electronic, post-punk sludge,
                borrowing a title from &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"&gt;Joy Division&lt;/a&gt;
                while releasing the album on Warp. The bass on “Rolling Stone,” a duet with South African singer &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30631-petite-noir/"&gt;Petite Noir&lt;/a&gt;, is pure New Order.
                “Ain’t It Funny,” with its bold horns, recalls the &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4134-the-stooges/"&gt;Stooges&lt;/a&gt;’ flirtations with free jazz
                and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/307-bauhaus/"&gt;Bauhaus&lt;/a&gt; at their most bombastic.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The thirty-five-year-old Brown has an old-head mentality as a rapper: play a song and he’ll rap
                on it. Make any beat and he’ll rap on it. It’s about rhymes, wordplay, and (for lack of a better term),
                &lt;i&gt;bars&lt;/i&gt;. This approach isn’t currently fashionable, but there’s a pleasure in hearing
                someone else’s joy at putting words together—Brown’s old-school bent intermittently hits some delirious
                highs, from “Slice your tomato if you owe us for the lettuce/Running through the sack of D sorta like
                Jerome Bettis,” to “Rocks about the size as the teeth in Chris Rock’s mouth.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The potential pitfall to this word-drunk approach is sometimes his songs just aren’t easy on
                the ears. The production here sounds wonderful—frequent collaborator &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29949-paul-white/"&gt;Paul White&lt;/a&gt; is credited with 10 songs,
                and the two have an easy chemistry, because both indulge in coloring outside traditional genre lines
                (White’s collaborative album with &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30520-open-mike-eagle/"&gt;Open
                Mike Eagle&lt;/a&gt; from earlier this year, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21617-hella-personal-film-festival/"&gt;Hella Personal Film
                Festival&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, is kind of like the quieter, gentler, non-evil version of this album,
                pulling from a different set of rock influences). But Brown sometimes lapses into his &lt;i&gt;Old&lt;/i&gt;
                flows, that idiosyncratic style where he falls off beat, gets in front of it, or simply yells above it.
                He avoids the frat-baiting EDM songs like “Dip” and “Smokin &amp;amp; Drinkin” that pocked &lt;i&gt;Old&lt;/i&gt;
                here, even though singles like “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18369-danny-brown-when-it-rain/"&gt;When It Rain&lt;/a&gt;”
                (more vintage Brown than anything from the past five years) and “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18491-danny-brown-pneumonia/"&gt;Pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;” flirt
                with that sound. But fortunately they’re too rough around the edges, too jumpy, too dark to soundtrack a
                scene like &lt;a href="https://vine.co/v/hUWzgTeYzZM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.
                To its credit, &lt;i&gt;Atrocity Exhibition&lt;/i&gt; balances its sonic elements and never slips into
                the mush of guitars and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5441-the-new-danger/"&gt;bad&lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1565-electric-circus/"&gt;ideas&lt;/a&gt; that
                threatened to infiltrate rap at the dawn of this century. White, Brown’s most gifted and consistent
                collaborator, keeps things at an even keel.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;No matter what's going on with the music, Brown’s acute emotional writing is once again on full
                display. Where &lt;i&gt;XXX&lt;/i&gt; seemed to promise a way out, &lt;i&gt;Old&lt;/i&gt; reflected (and
                sometimes reveled in) the lifestyle afforded him through his breakout success. This record, as dark,
                dingy, and uncomfortable as it is, continues to suggest something deeper is haunting Brown. “Everybody
                say, you got a lot to be proud of/Been high this whole time, don’t realize what I done/‘Cause when I’m
                all alone, feels like no one care/Isolate myself and don’t go nowhere,” he offers. He so internalizes
                all of his demons that, for the third record in this implied trilogy, you start to worry—is he
                irredeemably lost? Is his pain a response to his upbringing in Detroit, ground zero for armchair
                sociologists looking for a symbol of American decay? How long before the dam finally breaks? The great
                “Lost” here brings all these concerns to a head. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;And then there’s “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18533-danny-brown-really-doe-ft-kendrick-lamar-ab-soul-and-earl-sweatshirt/"&gt;Really
                Doe&lt;/a&gt;,” produced by Detroit compatriot &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/11216-black-milk/"&gt;Black Milk&lt;/a&gt;, which juts out on the
                geography of the album because it features guest rappers (B-Real merely shows up for the hook on “Get
                Hi”) and also because it’s the only song not directly about Brown’s demons. It’s a &lt;i&gt;fun&lt;/i&gt;
                track, and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"&gt;Earl Sweatshirt&lt;/a&gt;
                does that thing where he acts like he’s not rapping but ends up murdering everyone anyway while
                expending as little energy as possible. “I was a liar as a kid, so now I’m honest as fuck,” Earl offers,
                his unwavering delivery always imbuing what he raps with a startling amount of intimacy. You sometimes
                wish Brown could hit these more casually real notes more frequently, like he did on the origin story
                “EWNESW” from &lt;i&gt;XXX&lt;/i&gt; or the blackout bars of “Greatest Rapper Ever” and “White Stripes”
                from 2010’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14760-the-hybrid/"&gt;The Hybrid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.
                But Brown is too good a writer and too focused on the whole not to carry heavy feelings into all his
                songs, like “some people say I think too much/I don’t think they think enough,” from “Rolling Stone,”
                and “your work killing fiends/‘cause you cut it with Fentanyl,” from “Ain’t It Funny.” These reflective
                lines are the work of a smart writer with an eye for hard-earned detail, and &lt;i&gt;Atrocity
                Exhibition&lt;/i&gt; finds Brown back behind the lens, capturing raw emotion with grainy 16mm.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Bon Iver: 22, A Million</title>
            <link>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22420-22-a-million/</link>
            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;There’s a line deep in Thomas Pynchon’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Inherent Vice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
                wherein Doc, a small-time stoner-sleuth, considers the dissolution of the 1960s, wondering if the decade
                wasn’t merely “a little parenthesis of light, might close after all, and all be lost, taken back into
                darkness.” It’s a funny way to think about time—that an entire era can be nudged back into the ether,
                erased. But on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;22, A Million&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, the extraordinary third full-length from &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"&gt;Bon Iver&lt;/a&gt;, Justin Vernon echoes Doc’s
                somber pondering. These are fluttery, skeletal songs that struggle against known trajectories and then
                threaten to disappear entirely. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;22, A
                Million&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; might be musically distant from
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10709-for-emma-forever-ago/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;For Emma, Forever Ago&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, the collection of aching folk tunes Vernon debuted in 2007—mostly gone
                are the acoustic strums, replaced by lurching, electronic gasps born from the Messina, a doctored
                combination of the Prismizer software plug-in and some hardware that was invented by Vernon and his
                engineer, Chris Messina. But the albums share an ideology. All things go, taken back into darkness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;22, A Million&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is certainly Bon Iver’s most difficult record; it’s the work of a
                songwriter who seems to have lost interest in established, easily deciphered forms, a possibility Vernon
                has been hinting at for nearly all of his career. In 2006, Vernon, then living in North Carolina, was
                emotionally razed by a perfect storm of shitty turns: his band broke up, his relationship dissolved, he
                came down with an acute case of mononucleosis. He did what any reasonable person with an eye toward
                self-care would do: decamp to his family’s hunting cabin in rural Wisconsin, drink a gang of beers,
                watch endless hours of “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Northern Exposure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;,” and write a batch of lonesome, yearning folk songs on his acoustic
                guitar. His high, brittle falsetto gave these pieces an otherworldly quality, as if they had blown in on
                a particularly cold wind. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;For Emma, Forever Ago&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; was, in its own way, an experimental record—Vernon’s vocals and phrasing
                are deeply unusual; its stories are impressionistic, fractured—but because it’s so heavy with heartbreak
                and loss, it feels intimate, authentic, easy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;22,
                A Million&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is comparatively strange and
                exploratory, but its worries are more existential. The album opens with a high, undulating voice
                (Vernon, singing into an OP-1, a combination synthesizer, sampler, and sequencer) announcing, “It might
                be over soon,” and goes on to examine the idea of impermanence. Nearly all of its songs contain a
                question of some sort, as if Vernon’s own reckoning with the inevitability of decay has led him to
                interrogate every last thing he’s seen or known. Inasmuch as his lyrics are narrative—and they have
                always been more connotative than exegetic—he seems preoccupied with whether or not a life has meaning.
                “Oh then, how we gonna cry? Cause it once might not mean something?” he asks on “715 - CRΣΣKS.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"&gt;Kanye West&lt;/a&gt; once called Vernon his
                “favorite living artist,” and has long professed a deep and unexpected admiration for “Woods,” the
                closing track from 2009’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Blood Bank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; EP, and an obvious precursor to “715 - CRΣΣKS,” itself a kind of warped a
                capella jam. “Woods” featured no instrumentation, but is merely five minutes of Vernon singing through
                Auto-Tune, in ghostly harmony with himself. In retrospect, “Woods” feels like a revelation: it was not
                only an unexpected affirmation of pop’s future—artists aggressively distorting their vocals, feeding
                their voices into machines in order to build spectral, nagging songs that reflect alienation, arguably
                the reigning sensation of our time—but of Vernon’s own trajectory. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Plenty of beloved contemporary artists, from &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"&gt;Dylan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"&gt;Neil Young&lt;/a&gt; on, have ditched the
                supposed purity of folk music to push the work harder, to make art that’s less reliant on a tradition
                and invests, instead, in the strangeness of the present moment and collective uncertainty about the
                future. Trading on preexisting pathways—it’s too easy. Vernon isn’t alone in his hunger for true,
                tectonic innovation, for songs that seem tethered to and reflective of their actual time and place: &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"&gt;Radiohead&lt;/a&gt; has been mirroring anxiety
                about the encroachment of electronics and virtual living since &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Kid A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, a
                record that also required them to warp if not abandon their beginnings as a guitar-rock band.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Beyond its sonic striving, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;22, A Million&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
                is also a personal record about how to move forward through disorienting times. Vernon occasionally
                employs religious language to express his anxiety, some explicit (“consecration,” “confirmation”), some
                more plainly vernacular (“So as I’m standing at the station,” “I could go forward in the light”). He
                samples two gospel tunes: Mahalia Jackson’s live version of “How I Got Over,” from 1962, and the Supreme
                Jubilees’s “Standing in the Need of Prayer,” from 1980. There is a song titled “666 ʇ,” and another
                titled “&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18510-bon-iver-33-god/"&gt;33 ‘GOD.’&lt;/a&gt;”
                A bit of marginalia in the album’s liner notes (“Why are you so FAR from saving me?”) is attributed to
                Psalm 22, though in the King James Bible, that imploration is for help, not salvation (“Why art thou so
                far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?”). Either way, Psalm 22 opens &lt;i&gt;in medias
                res&lt;/i&gt;: its author is undergoing an urgent crisis of faith. So is Vernon?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Maybe. Musically, Vernon resists not just
                verse-chorus-verse, but all the ways in which Western cultures have come to conceptualize narrative. As
                kids, we’re taught how stories work, and we use that rubric to organize and make sense of the events of
                our lives. But the imposition of structure can be violent; perhaps, Vernon suggests, the idea that we
                are organizing events at all is patently nuts. So when he ventures a line like “We’ve galvanized the
                squall of it all,” from “8 (circle),” it feels like a mission statement. There is solace in resisting
                formal structures, in both acknowledging and embracing a certain amount of chaos. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;It’s the same story on “00000 Million,” the album’s
                haunting closing track, where Vernon samples a wobbly line borrowed from the Irish folksinger Fionn
                Regan: “The days have no numbers.” Pitted against the record’s obsessive numerology—each song has a
                number in its title—it lands like an admission of defeat. There’s resignation in his voice, which gives
                way to desolation. The song’s lyrics will be familiar to anyone wondering if they’ll ever actually start
                to feel better, while still continuing to do something they know is hurting them: “If it’s harmed, it
                harmed me, it’ll harm me, I let it in.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;For a while now, Vernon has been building songs in a
                modular way, and there are moments here (like the meandering last minute of “21 M♢♢N WATER”) where it
                feels as if he could’ve jiggled the pieces together a little more—where his disavowal of connective
                tissue feels less deliberate than random. This is evident, in part, because he is exceptionally good at
                writing melancholic laments in the highly structured style of ’80s soft-rock giants like &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/33600-bonnie-raitt/"&gt;Bonnie Raitt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/33658-bruce-hornsby/"&gt;Bruce Hornsby&lt;/a&gt; (Vernon has covered
                Raitt’s “I Can’t Make You Love Me,” and Vernon and Hornsby have collaborated on several occasions;
                “00000 Million” feels like it could have been recorded by either). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“8 (circle)” is the most immediately reminiscent of
                Vernon’s last record, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15551-bon-iver/"&gt;Bon
                Iver, Bon Iver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, itself now
                recognizable as a clear midpoint between &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Emma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; and here; it’s also the album’s most conventionally composed track, with
                the smallest amount of vocal manipulation. Elsewhere, Vernon’s vocals are filtered until they begin to
                actually dissolve, as if they have been dunked in a tub of lye. The song’s stunning emotional peaks—I
                come to a full stop every time I hear Vernon sing, “I’m standing in the street now, and I carry his
                guitar,” his voice steady and deep, as if he’s announcing himself to someone he loves—are so plainly
                beautiful it’s hard not to mourn, briefly, for the Bon Iver of yesteryear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;But &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;22, A Million&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; sounds only like
                itself. There are precedents for all of Vernon’s moves deep in the histories of rock‘n’roll and rhythm
                and blues and electronic music—and, more immediately, on newer records by West, &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"&gt;Frank Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"&gt;James Blake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"&gt;Chance the Rapper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31897-francis-and-the-lights/"&gt;Francis and the Lights&lt;/a&gt;,
                and Radiohead. But this particular amalgamation is so twitchy and idiosyncratic it feels truly singular.
                Its searching is bottomless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Nicolas Jaar: Sirens</title>
            <link>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22444-sirens/</link>
            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;There are only about 45 seconds left on &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29422-nicolas-jaar/"&gt;Nicolas Jaar&lt;/a&gt;’s new album &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sirens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; when
                something astounding happens. Heralded by a selection of drums and birdcall synths, a gospel cry
                arrives, shrouded in distortion and punctuated by sharp arrhythmic drumming. The most useful words to
                describe this are the silliest and most hyperbolic: awesome, transcendent, timeless or more accurately,
                out-of-time. It begs for pretension, for the vocabulary of divinity and “high art,” for references to
                religious philosophers and poets of the West that you barely remember from college, Milton and
                Kierkegaard, Eliot and Blake. And though there are many similarly striking moments on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sirens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, this
                one stands out for its brevity and particular beauty. It is a moment thoroughly earned by the album that
                precedes it, and in less than a minute, it’s gone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This moment—a supernova flash of prodigious skill—can be
                seen as something of a stand-in for Jaar’s career to date. In 2011, when Jaar was just 21, he released
                his debut album, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15122-space-is-only-noise/"&gt;Space
                Is Only Noise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; introducing a downtempo combination of psychedelia and dance music that
                vaulted him into the vanguard of the world’s electronic artists. The record came alive in a room, its
                amorphous body emerging from the stereo, its limbs unfolding into every corner. His ability to conjure
                up what seemed like an extra dimension in his music made you aware of the tautology: space was noise,
                but he made noise seem like space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The next year Jaar revealed the depth of his talent for
                collage with his &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://soundcloud.com/otherpeoplerecords/csp06-nicolas-jaar-essential" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Essential Mix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
                for BBC Radio 1. These mixes are often superlative, but his felt more personal than most, even as it
                showcased his interest in referencing the texts of others. In one of many sophisticated in-jokes, Jaar,
                who is Chilean-American, introduced the operative sample from &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"&gt;Jay Z&lt;/a&gt;’s “My 1st Song,” with Jay Z’s own
                voice. That vocal prepared listeners to hear the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4219-the-black-album/"&gt;Black Album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;closer before
                Jaar dropped the original version, “Tu y Tu Mirar, Yo y Mi Cancion,” by the Chilean band, Los Ángeles
                Negros, in its place. The mix was filled with moments like these—jam-packed with allusions but still
                absorbing for those who didn’t catch the references.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;And then, Jaar shrank away from center stage. In 2013, he
                started his own label, Other People, partly to foster the careers of his musician friends. Jaar is a
                generous collaborator—artists like &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/32294-dave-harrington/"&gt;Dave
                Harrington&lt;/a&gt;, his partner in the duo &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30070-darkside/"&gt;Darkside&lt;/a&gt;,
                have been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://www.villagevoice.com/music/dave-harrington-travels-from-the-darkside-and-into-your-heart-6650077"
                rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;eager to credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; his willingness to help them with their own work. But the instinct to work
                with others may not have been purely selfless. Jaar felt enormous pressure to replicate his early
                success. In an interview with Pitchfork in 2013, he confessed that he was scared of releasing music that
                wasn’t up to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9211-nicolas-jaar/"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;those standards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“For the first five years of making music, I did it
                because I had fun,” he said. “When it started to get real, I was like, ‘Now if I put out something else
                and it's not as good as what I did before, people will start thinking I suck.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;So Jaar produced others’ projects and made critically
                acclaimed records with Harrington under the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18586-darkside-psychic/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Darkside&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; moniker. But slowly, over the last two years, he’s been creeping back
                toward the microphone, using his own name. First there were &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17484-nicolas-jaar-the-three-sides-of-audrey-and-why-shes-all-alone-now/"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;some extraordinary singles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. Then, last summer’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20791-pomegranates/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;Pomegranates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, a slippery
                alternate soundtrack to an old Russian film. Then &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;Nymphs—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;an uncollected EP,
                maybe?—excellent, but difficult to evaluate holistically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sirens &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;represents a full reemergence, as close as he may ever get to kicking over
                the mic stand. He doesn't reveal many new tricks, but his knowledge of his own palette is masterful in
                every moment. More poetic and thoughtful than ever before, Jaar maintains an ability to fit seemingly
                disparate sounds together as if they were always meant to find each other. Add the strands of political
                expression that are gathered on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sirens, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;often cloaked in odd textures, in Spanish, or in cryptic lyrics, and you
                have a record as compelling as any of Jaar’s other works.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;It opens with the track “Killing Time,” which feels like
                entering a labyrinth, or maybe a pyramid, something forbidding and funereal. The sound of a flag waves
                in the wind, keys like jagged wind chimes shatter on the floor. Nico is patient, but understands the
                need for progression, and though slower songs like this may linger in silence or briefly lavish
                attention on a particular effect, riff, or drum sound, they never stop moving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Killing Time,” is silent, respectful, matching its
                lyrics (“We were just waiting…”) And then “The Governor” which shares a post-punk edge with another
                song, “Three Sides of Nazareth,” jolts the record into sudden motion. Those two tracks, with their
                driving rhythms and clear lyrics, are the easiest to glom on to on first listen. The words are more or
                less affixed to the music, in contrast with other tracks like “Killing Time” and parts of “No,” where
                lyrics seem to dwell in the spacious labyrinth evoked by the sound. On those tracks, you’re never sure
                exactly where you’re going to stumble upon a sudden string of words, of thoughts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;"The Governor" is fast and loud and urgent. When I
                listened to it out of sequence, I wondered whether those qualities were imposed on “The Governor”
                because it's only fast and loud and urgent in comparison to “Killing Time,” or whether it actually is
                those things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; These are the kind of thoughts that
                psychedelia provokes at its best, and Jaar adores these puzzles. It’s his obsession with setting up
                dichotomies and resolving them that places him firmly in a Western tradition. He’s able to work a kind
                of alchemy upon the raw elements of his music, making one thing into its polar opposite: hard into soft,
                ugly into pretty, slow into fast. Like the word “sirens” itself, (the ancient temptress, the modern
                alarms), his music is able to evoke opposing ideas at the same time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;These contradictions give &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sirens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; its
                strength, particularly during the album’s centerpiece, the song "No." It’s the only segment of music on
                the digital version of the album that includes a musical element not written, recorded, performed,
                mixed, and produced by Nico. (It’s a Chilean harp piece, “Lagrimas,” by Sergio Cuevas.) This section
                helps us to understand the mystery at the heart of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;Sirens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, represented by the line of
                Spanish lyrics adorning its cover. The end of “Leaves,” the entirety of “No,” and the beginning of
                “Three Sides of Nazareth,” orbit around two conversations. The first seems to be a recording of a young
                Nico speaking with his father, the artist Alfredo Jaar. They discuss a statue being attacked by lions.
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The words of “No” are in Spanish, and they contain the
                second discussion, which serves as a parable that illuminates the first. An unhappy neighbor approaches
                Nico, and they discuss multiple contradictions—the far and the near, the inside and the outside. But the
                core of their conversation are the words from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sirens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;’ cover: “Ya dijimos no pero el si esta en todo.” This translates as: “We
                already said no but the yes is in everything,” a reference to the Chilean national plebiscite, a 1988
                referendum on democracy in the country. In the referendum, on whether Chile should continue to be ruled
                by General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power about 15 years earlier, voting “no” was voting “yes”
                to democracy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;But if, as Jaar sings, “The yes is in everything,” the
                idea is that we don’t need to see the future to know that nothing ever really changes, that the cycle
                continues whether you vote for democracy or not. In turn, it suggests that the statue under discussion
                between little Nico and Alfredo, (whose own &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://theculturetrip.com/south-america/chile/articles/chilean-artist-alfredo-jaar-controversy-through-art/"
                rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;complicated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a
                href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/alfredo-jaar-and-the-happiness-of-chile/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;politics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; are
                worth noting) could very well have been of Salvador Allende, who Pinochet ousted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;There are plenty of extraordinary references on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sirens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; that
                I’m sure I missed. But, as with the Essential Mix, as with any collage, being ignorant of any of these
                things hardly lessens the weight of the music. What you pick up from the album is a real suspicion of
                power&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;from “The Governor” (“All the blood’s hidden in the governor’s trunk”) to
                “Killing Time” (“Money, it seems, needs its working class.”) And at the same time, Nico, through the
                music, exercises his own power, pulling on his listeners and compelling them to move, dance, think, and
                engage with one another, or sometimes to sit silently and take it all in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Nico's aversion to authority reaches a climax with that
                last track, “History Lesson,” which ends with those 45 transcendent seconds that I’m still failing to
                put into words. “History Lesson” takes its cues from old soul and doo-wop, like the &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"&gt;Beach Boys&lt;/a&gt; at their most
                psychedelic. Think “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2uoXsaGozo" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Feel Flows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;”
                and those unfolding, enveloping missiles of soul.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The music on “History Lesson” is almost laughably gentle
                at first, and Jaar employs a trick favored by both &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2452-john-lennon/"&gt;John Lennon&lt;/a&gt; (“Run for Your Life”) and
                &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5301-paul-mccartney/"&gt;Paul McCartney&lt;/a&gt; (“Maxwell’s
                Silver Hammer”), juxtaposing inviting music with disturbing lyrics. Here’s how his history lesson
                starts: “Chapter one: We fucked up/Chapter two: We did it again, and again, and again, and again/Chapter
                three: We didn’t say sorry.” And so on. The words are a harsh rebuke of any political system. But the
                music is tender. And the track is bleak and funny, and naïve and wise, and political and personal. It
                feels like everything all at once. It feels like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;Sirens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;“I retired from my fight,” &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/7485-hamilton-leithauser/"&gt;Hamilton
                Leithauser&lt;/a&gt; crooned with a smirk on his &lt;a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ9mP4U-CEA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;first great solo
                tune&lt;/a&gt;. “I Retired”’s very existence confirms that the singer didn’t actually give up, but
                Leithauser’s point about getting older and figuring out how to keep creating felt like a painfully
                self-aware revelation upon arrival, six months after his longtime band the &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4548-the-walkmen/"&gt;Walkmen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/news/53165-the-walkmen-go-on-indefinite-hiatus/"&gt;announced an indefinite
                hiatus&lt;/a&gt;. “All the fire in your heart won’t help/All the smoke up in your head,” he continued,
                figuring that “as long as [he] can keep the train rolling, then all [his] friends will always know
                they’ll never be alone.” Consider it a self-fulfilling prophecy tucked inside a nugget of irony: A song
                called “I Retired” directly spawned Leithauser’s next musical direction.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;“I Retired” was one of two songs from Leithauser’s 2014 solo debut, &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19401-hamilton-leithauser-black-hours/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Black
                Hours&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;that he worked on with &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/12072-rostam-batmanglij/"&gt;Rostam&lt;/a&gt; Batmanglij. Leithauser
                and the former &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"&gt;Vampire Weekend&lt;/a&gt;
                multi-instrumentalist/producer &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1258-rostam-and-hamilton-leithauser-on-their-new-joint-album-sax-dreams-and-hangovers/"&gt;apparently
                bonded over &lt;i&gt;shooby doo wops&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, their deadpan version of which sounds like the
                &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5885-the-flamingos/"&gt;Flamingos&lt;/a&gt; came down with a
                case of urban malaise. That vocal technique is all over “I Retired” and again on &lt;i&gt;I Had a Dream
                That You Were Mine,&lt;/i&gt; emblematic of what makes Leithauser and Batmanglij’s first collaborative
                full-length the rare release that looks backwards without falling victim to retro pastiche.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;With Batmanglij’s piano and Leithauser’s voice as their guiding forces, the duo answer a
                question that has eluded many a musician before: How do you incorporate the music of the past without
                losing yourself in what’s already been done? Even those beloved harmonies represent just one tool in a
                deep kit, right alongside Spanish guitar, Disney strings, bawdy horns, tender banjo, airy vocal loops,
                and cinematic reverb. Together, Leithauser and Batmanglij work their way through nearly seven decades of
                musical history—from doo-wop and country-rock to &lt;a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Sko_A6dU_U" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Leonard Cohen-style
                torch songs&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/14507-george-martin/"&gt;George
                Martin&lt;/a&gt;-indebted baroque-pop Rostam &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGo1BE4H6e4"
                target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;often used&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NVkWncUv9c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;to make&lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTjwXwl_be8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;VW twinkle&lt;/a&gt;—but
                they also don’t forget who they are in the process: one of ’00s indie rock’s most charismatic singers,
                alongside one of its most creative songwriter-producers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If there was any lingering doubt that Rostam was Vampire Weekend’s special sauce (&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/news/63158-rostam-batmanglij-leaves-vampire-weekend/"&gt;before his departure
                earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;), look to &lt;i&gt;I Had a Dream That You Were Mine&lt;/i&gt;. The
                convincing ease with which the duo weaves disparate musical styles together seems distinctly Rostam—the
                work of someone who made Afropop, calypso, ’80s synth-pop, samples from &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"&gt;M.I.A.&lt;/a&gt; to Toots and the Maytals, and a
                half-dozen other global styles fit together within music that often was held up as the indie rock
                zeitgeist. Here on “You Ain’t That Young Kid,” a spirited &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"&gt;Dylan&lt;/a&gt;-on-piano-and-harmonica act turns
                towards pleading slide guitar, then an echo chamber of angel voices, then a slow dance of ’60s organ and
                steel drum, then a tidy harpsichord minuet—then, impossibly, all at once. The five-minute standout ends
                as a gilded acoustic singalong, the overwhelming sentimentality of which is amplified by an
                Instagram-filter of a synth line growing underneath. Rostam’s production is highly visual, and listening
                to this record, you get a sense of all the colors he must see when he’s behind the boards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But RostHam is an equal partnership, and Leithauser reminds you why you were drawn to the
                Walkmen in the first place. He gives what has to be his strongest and most wide-ranging collection of
                vocal performances on record to date, spanning from talk-crooning to punkish howling to
                folk-balladeering to heavenly harmonizing to raspily brooding about as he first perfected on “&lt;a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWR1h-5EzUo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Rat&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Black Hours&lt;/i&gt;’ primary flaw was that it alternated sharply between Leithauser
                &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYgqZYQYzwA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;going Bublé&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; in
                his own way &lt;/span&gt;and simply channeling his old band. &lt;i&gt;I Had a Dream That You Were Mine
                &lt;/i&gt;manages to incorporate these two modes in the larger context of its 20th-century-pop
                scrapbook—on songs about longing and looking back, no less. And it’s the songs where Leithauser loses
                himself in what was and what could be that his voice sounds best. On “Rough Going (I Won’t Let Up),”
                atop a creaking piano line and a spiraling sax solo, Leithauser screams like a man possessed that he
                won’t let up, but he holds it together, and the song never lets its barroom singalong quality devolve
                into total shambles.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This is a slightly more mature Leithauser, but that life experience can also be a curse. Over
                the course of the album, the streets of downtown New York become littered with memories, and even the
                good ones hurt a little because they’re faded now. The album is drenched in this wistful feeling, the
                crowning achievement of which is “When the Truth Is…” There are many moving parts that go into making
                this song work, from the echoing swirl of percussion and piano to the snippet of film dialogue at the
                end, but they’re rendered so perfectly, all you hear by the end is straight swoon. The main thing Rostam
                and Hamilton get right about doo-wop is that it often makes romantic yearning shimmer like a slow-moving
                disco ball.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Towards the beginning of the album—on “Sick as a Dog,” the song that sounds the most modern
                (and a little like Spoon)—Leithauser harmonizes with himself, “I use the same voice I always had.”
                Indeed, it’s not that Leithauser has dramatically changed since his days in the Walkmen; rather, pairing
                with Rostam has brought out the best in him. It’s rare for collaborative albums between known entities
                to feel like equal reflections of both parties, but RostHam find a middle-ground in mutual longing for
                the past. It’s the kind of album Leithauser can be proud of—you know, once he’s old enough to actually
                retire.&lt;/p&gt;

                Letterman goes, as she slathered the befuddled host&amp;#8217;s voice in quizzical delay. Laughter
                persisted. &amp;#8220;Tell &amp;#8216;em what we&amp;#160;got here,&amp;#8221; Letterman asked, and
                Ciani pointed out her Prophet-5 synthesizer, a vocoder, a frequency follower, an Eventide harmonizer&amp;#8212;&amp;#8220;That
                means nothing to anybody but you!&amp;#8221; the host interjects. &amp;#8220;Do the one where it sounds
                like the whole studio&amp;#8217;s gonna explode!&amp;#8221; Ciani offered a pitched-shifted affirmation:
                &amp;#8220;Don't be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;afraiiid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;...&amp;#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In 1980, the pioneering Ciani&amp;#8212;who would go on
                to earn several Grammy nominations in the New Age category&amp;#8212;was a decade into her experiments
                with the modular Buchla synthesizers, which she used to create dramatic seconds-long effects for the
                likes of the Xenon pinball game, PBS, and Atari. And Ciani had also just begun work on her own debut
                masterpiece, the elegantly spare &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Seven Waves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, released in Japan in 1982 and the U.S. two years later&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&amp;#8220;In
                order to see something, you have to have a concept of it,&amp;#8221; Ciani, now 70, told &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://thequietus.com/articles/08406-suzanne-ciani-interview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;The
                Quietus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&amp;#160;in 2012. &amp;#8220;People
                had no concept of electronic music back then. So even if they were sitting in front of a machine and
                sound was coming out of it, they still didn&amp;#8217;t get it.&amp;#8221; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Even as electricity has become the preeminent
                building-block of our musical lexicon, the Buchla&amp;#8212;with its wires spilling over a landscape of
                knobs, its tactile sense of exploration, of conversing subtly with the machine&amp;#8212;is still
                extremely rare. But fate has its way of bringing outsiders together. That Ciani would encounter a fellow
                Buchla synthesist, the 30-year-old &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/32669-kaitlyn-aurelia-smith/"&gt;Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith&lt;/a&gt;,
                while sitting on the floor at a dinner party in the isolated California coastal town of Bolinas, where
                they both happen to live, is fantastic serendipity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Ciani herself had abandoned the Buchla for decades,
                making her name as a classical pianist. It wasn&amp;#8217;t until a 2012 reissue of her work, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16284-lixiviation/"&gt;Lixiviation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, by the Finders Keepers label, that she became &amp;#8220;reincarnated as
                a Buchla person,&amp;#8221; and a reissue of her groundbreaking 1975 &lt;a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d2yKUQSbgc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Buchla concerts&lt;/a&gt;
                followed. Before a European tour spurred on by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Lixiviation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, Ciani hired Smith as a studio assistant. New York&amp;#8217;s &lt;a
                href="http://igetrvng.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;RVNG&lt;/a&gt; label ultimately asked them
                to collaborate for the 13th installment of its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://igetrvng.com/shop/category/frkwys-releases/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;FRKWYS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://igetrvng.com/shop/category/frkwys-releases/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt; series&lt;/a&gt;,
                which brings together musicians of different generations in an improvisatory setting, always with the
                care of a gallery piece. In a film produced by RVNG during the making of the album&amp;#8212;at Ciani&amp;#8217;s
                home near a cliff with exquisite views of the Pacific&amp;#8212;the elder artist is seen with her Buchla
                200 E, a wooden box propped open with wires all flowing about, a full display of the machine and its
                sound&amp;#8217;s infinity. Smith uses the slightly more contained Buchla Music Easel, which appears
                like a mysterious pad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The resulting &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sunergy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;is 54&amp;#160;minutes
                of generative music in three&amp;#160;pieces, &amp;#8220;A New Day,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Closed
                Circuit,&amp;#8221; and the bonus track &amp;#8220;Retrograde&amp;#8221; (absent from the vinyl
                pressing). Their energy exchange is potent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sunergy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is far from the lovely analog melodies and white noise that Ciani released
                on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Seven Waves&amp;#8212;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;it more so shares the thick, dewy feel of Smith&amp;#8217;s 2016 &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21562-ears/"&gt;EARS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;but
                as they cross-pollinate, those titular crests are all over. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sunergy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is
                made of crashing waves and the glittering sun on water, meditations from the &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"&gt;Terry Riley&lt;/a&gt; school of minimalism, as
                if &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30634-laurie-spiegel/"&gt;Laurie Spiegel&lt;/a&gt; had
                composed for the tides rather than the cosmos. Ciani said she had a &amp;#8220;long-standing desire to
                orchestrate the sunrise... [and] there was this synergy between us, and also the energy of the sun and
                the energy of the ocean... I think that&amp;#8217;s where &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sunergy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; came
                from.&amp;#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&amp;#8220;A New Day&amp;#8221; opens with an ominous,
                tectonic rumble that engulfs you like a circling Tibetan singing bowl. Sounds cut in from all angles,
                with static juxtaposing sparkling bleeps and textures that pop like candy. There are sounds of epic
                winds and rippling water, and its hypnosis seems to say something about journeying through time, about
                nature mixing with the artificial, about the promise and threat of the future. &amp;#8220;Closed Circuit&amp;#8221;
                comprises simpler&amp;#160;synth figures, before swimming far out into a dark sea, a picture of the
                unknown. &amp;#8220;Retrograde&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;takes on harsher, denser noise,&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;but
                its menacing scrape&amp;#160;is tempered with light.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;All along, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sunergy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; makes
                for an inquisitive space to inhabit. The headier and grander it grows, the more its heavy drones swarm,
                the more undeniable the duo&amp;#8217;s alchemy proves to be. &amp;#8220;I was in love with it,&amp;#8221;
                Ciani &lt;a
                href="http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/20183/1/suzanne-ciani-americas-first-female-synth-hero"
                target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;once said&lt;/a&gt; of her introduction to the Buchla, &amp;#8220;It
                took my whole life&amp;#8230; It was my boyfriend! I thought there was something wrong with me, because
                I was in love with a machine.&amp;#8221; But her devotion was prescient. It is moving to hear Ciani and
                Smith&amp;#8212;in some sense, creative soulmates&amp;#8212;commune so deeply. Because people like Ciani
                don&amp;#8217;t come down to Earth to join the world. They recruit comrades to enter their own.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;People die in &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/710-nick-cave/"&gt;Nick Cave&lt;/a&gt; songs. They get &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSl4KX7zBTQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;wiped out in floods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahr4KFl79WI" target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;zapped in electric chairs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTSpvCV34Ok"
                target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;mowed down en masse in saloon
                shoot-outs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. For Cave, death serves as both
                a dramatic and rhetorical device—it’s great theater, but it’s also swift justice for those who have done
                wrong, be it in the eyes of a lover or the Lord. As I once heard him quip in concert: “This next one’s a
                morality tale… they’re all morality tales, really. It’s what I do.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;But despite amassing a songbook that needs its own
                morgue, on their 16th album together, Nick Cave &amp;amp; the Bad Seeds must contend with something that
                is not so easily depicted: the sound of mourning. In July 2015, Cave’s 15-year-old son Arthur—one of his
                twin sons with wife Susie Bick—died when he accidentally fell from a cliff near the family’s current
                home in Brighton, England. The writing and recording of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Skeleton Tree&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
                had commenced before the tragic incident, but the album was completed in its aftermath, and its specter
                hangs over it like a black fog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This is a record that exists in the headspace and guts of
                someone who’s endured an unspeakable, inconsolable trauma. And though the songs are not explicitly about
                Arthur they are uncannily about coming to terms with loss and the realization that things will never be
                the same again. As if to reinforce &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Skeleton
                Tree&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;’s therapeutic quality, the notoriously
                taciturn Cave opened the studio door to director Andrew Dominik, who documented the album’s
                completion—in 3D, no less—for the companion film &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1289-what-does-it-mean-to-experience-an-album-for-the-first-time-as-a-film/"&gt;One
                More Time With Feeling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. It’s
                almost as if by thrusting himself into the spotlight during his darkest hour, Cave was issuing a form of
                karmic payback, penance for the pain and reckoning he’s inflicted on so many characters in his songs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;If you try to listen to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Skeleton Tree&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
                removed from its somber context, the album feels very much like a natural step from 2013’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17618-push-the-sky-away/"&gt;Push the Sky Away&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, whose premium on disquieting, ambient textures and wandering-mind
                lyricism now seems like less like a momentary detour than the gateway into an intriguing new phase for
                the Bad Seeds. But where that record rallied for show-stopping epics like “Jubilee Street” and “Higgs
                Boson Blues,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Skeleton Tree&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;drones and jitters
                offer no such moments of release. The skies, seas, and mermaids that previously dominated Cave’s
                thoughts are still very much present here. But on the opening “Jesus Alone,” he’s wading deeper into the
                chop, the safety of the shoreline fading further out of view as he gets swept up by pattering drum
                drifts, humming organs, and swelling orchestration. The song was among the first Cave wrote for the
                record, yet its opening image—“You fell from the sky, crash-landed in a field near the River Adur”—feels
                unbearably prescient. It isn’t so much about the finality of death as the ambiguity of the afterlife:
                Cave’s orator welcomes a litany of souls into purgatory, but his stern proclamation—“With my voice, I am
                calling you”—makes it unclear whether they’ll be redeemed in heaven or damned to hell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This great unknowing serves as the album’s guiding
                principle. In Cave’s wounded voice, you hear him grapple in real-time with the incidental prophecies of
                his lyrics and his need to get the job done. In one of the album’s most harrowing moments, he closes the
                bleak, grief-stricken ballad “Girl in Amber” by repeating the words, “Don’t touch me,” as if a consoling
                hug would only exacerbate the pain. Not every song is infused with such omens, but their restlessness is
                emblematic of the album’s fraught recording process. By Bad Seeds’ standards, “Rings of Saturn” is
                practically a chillwave song, its dusty drum loop smothered in a soft-focus synth gauze. But Cave’s
                numbed, sing-speak delivery is laid bare above the smooth texture—not even a cooing chorus of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN23lFKfpck" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;millennial whoops&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
                can rouse him. And as surprising as it is to hear a dogged non-conformist like Cave embrace some au
                courant pop device, here it functions as a faded reminder of a more carefree time—like how, in our most
                helpless moments, a sentimental song can turn you into a mess.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Rings of Saturn” is one of several tracks on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Skeleton Tree&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
                where Cave sings about or through an enigmatic female character. Like one of those “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sopranos”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; episodes where
                Tony is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://uproxx.com/tv/sopranos-dream-sequences/" target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;trapped in his dreams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, nothing makes sense on the surface, but every hallucinatory image and
                mysterious gesture is loaded with circuitous significance. The “woman in a yellow dress surrounded by a
                charm of hummingbirds” awaiting her call to the pearly gates in “Jesus Alone” could very well be the one
                at the center of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Magneto,” whose quivering
                atmospherics and panting delivery suggest a goth &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21092-astral-weeks-his-band-and-the-street-choir/"&gt;Astral
                Weeks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. “It was the year I
                officially became the bride of Jesus,” Cave intones, before blithely revealing, “The urge to kill
                somebody was basically overwhelming/I had such hard blues down there in the supermarket queues.” But
                that prosaic setting is revisited from a different vantage in the parched-throat synth-pop serenade “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18520-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds-i-need-you/"&gt;I Need You&lt;/a&gt;,”
                where the crestfallen narrator sings, “I saw you standing there in the supermarket with your red dress,
                falling, and your eyes are to the ground,” as if observing a woman he once loved but no longer
                recognizes in her current distressed state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;And yet even the relentless ache of “I Need You”—the
                closest Cave has come to actually crying on record—hardly prepares you for a pair of closing tracks that
                will reduce the most hardened hearts to puddles. “Distant Sky” may initially come on like a simple
                invitation to escape (“Let us go now, my one true love/Call the gasman, cut the power off!”), but once
                the divine Danish vocalist Else Torp emerges, the song elevates to a form of secular last rites. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Musically, “Distant Sky” is all soothing organ tones and celestial
                orchestration, but the song’s weightlessness is utterly crushing, as Cave crystallizes the mood of
                Skeleton Tree in one trembling, devastating line: “They told us our gods would outlive us/But they
                lied.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;By contrast, the lilting gospel sway of the final title
                track feels more earthbound. It’s an attempt to step out of the void and reconnect with the waking world
                while recognizing that grieving doesn’t happen on a standard timeline—you don’t just hole yourself up
                for three months of weeping and then emerge fully recovered. Grief is a wraith of love that haunts your
                soul, emerging when you least expect it from the most mundane triggers and surroundings. “I call out,
                right across the sea,” Cave sings, “but the echo comes back empty.” However, the darkness has at least
                acquired enough definition for Cave to make out a path forward. The last line Cave sings on the album is
                “It’s all right now,” less a declaration of closure than an acceptance it may never come. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Angel Olsen: My Woman</title>
            <link>http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22282-my-woman/</link>
            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In 2010, &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29064-angel-olsen/"&gt;Angel Olsen&lt;/a&gt; was a folk singer. Her
                first great song, “If It’s Alive, It Will,” sounded radically spare, like it had been recorded inside of
                a closet, or perhaps in another world. It contained some three-dozen epiphanies—one for each line. “Know
                your own heart well/It’s the one that’s worth most of your time,” Olsen sang, a mantra so disarming and
                wise it could cut through the thickest lo-fi fog. “If It’s Alive, It Will” was pure empathy. You might
                implant it in your brain as a reminder of how to live. You could never forget, then, that solitude
                begets possibility, or that loving a person can transform your mind, or that someone in the universe is
                currently as lonely as you. “If It’s Alive, It Will” embodied the poised philosophy of Olsen’s songbook
                to come. Introverted dreamers—people who are quiet on the outside while the world rages so loudly within
                them—always live by this loner logic. Olsen gave it a melody.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Modern noises vanish when Olsen sings. From the bracing
                incantations of 2012’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17154-half-way-home/"&gt;Half
                Way Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; to Olsen’s folk-rock
                opus, 2014’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18956-angel-olsen-burn-your-fire-for-no-witness/"&gt;Burn Your
                Fire for No Witness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;,
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;her name is now synonymous with a voice.
                Each note tells a story. Hers are tales of absolute yearning and resilience. They honor the romance of
                being alone in your head. Olsen has perfected the idea that it is still possible—if language is precise
                enough, if the truth of your music is as elemental as color or blood—to write oneself out of time. Her
                lyrics have the conviction of someone like Fiona Apple: a profoundly individual presence that centers,
                above all, on self-reliance, on searing autonomy, on the act of becoming. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;My Woman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; does this more vividly and lucidly and daringly than before. If &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Burn Your Fire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
                was Olsen’s poetic manifesto, then &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;My Woman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; lives freely within its world. Together, the two albums remind me of
                something &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3842-patti-smith/"&gt;Patti Smith&lt;/a&gt; once
                said, in 1976, distinguishing the literary &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7277-horses-30th-anniversary-legacy-edition/"&gt;Horses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; from its follow-up, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:
                400;"&gt;Radio Ethiopia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, by calling the
                latter “total physical energy” and also more implicitly feminine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;My Woman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; walks
                a tightrope of love to figure out what it is—how to find it, how to allow it in, how to feel it, how to
                fight for it, how to let it go—by a person who does not lose herself in the process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The upbeat A-side ranges from the sun-kissed to the
                blindingly bright. In the final moments of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Burn
                Your Fire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, Olsen asked, “Won’t you open a
                window sometime/What’s so wrong with the light?” and here she responds. She offers witty and taunting
                rhinestone-cowgirl come-ons that would make &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5219-dolly-parton/"&gt;Dolly&lt;/a&gt;
                and &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2586-loretta-lynn/"&gt;Loretta&lt;/a&gt; proud. She lets
                loose a piercing, guttural, King-sized &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Baby!”
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;that shoots fire into the red. She shrieks
                “I’m still yours!” with sublime vivacity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;My
                Woman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; contains soda-pop rippers as pained
                and distraught and irreducible as any girl-group classic: “Heaven hits me when I see your face,” Olsen
                sings with wide-eyed optimism that wilts on arrival, “But you’ll never be mine.” So much of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;My Woman &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;is
                rock‘n’roll in the traditional sense, from a ’50s or ’60s jukebox, and it is positively electric, a
                total blast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18322-angel-olsen-intern/"&gt;Intern&lt;/a&gt;,” the synth
                meditation of an opener, is all shivers, a borderless dream-pop song that never quite begins or ends.
                It’s about the inescapable necessity, for all people, of figuring out who you are: “Still gotta wake up
                and be someone.” The winding synth melody has a surreal, Lynchian, merry-go-round shine. “I just wanna
                be alive/Make something real,” Olsen sings, a surprisingly conversational and &lt;/span&gt;sensible&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; proposition. “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18414-angel-olsen-shut-up-kiss-me/"&gt;Shut Up Kiss Me&lt;/a&gt;”
                has all the rapture of a black-and-white stop-action movie, with slapstick country humor: “Stop
                pretending I’m not there/When it’s clear that I’m not going anywhere,” Olsen sings. “If I’m out of sight
                then take another look around!” In the videos for both songs, Olsen donned a synthetic silver wig,
                bringing to mind the makeup of her beloved Dolly Parton: “I look so totally artificial, but I’ve always
                been the simplest person in the world,” Dolly has said. “I knew that there was wisdom and naturalness in
                me. The way I looked so false and was so real made a nice combination. It’s my fun.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;But Olsen’s fun songs—bright and sweet as they are—are a
                bit deceiving. The arrangements carry the levity and mania of infatuation, the feeling of total flight,
                but even here, Olsen’s writing is heavy as ever. (The poet Frank O’Hara once wrote, “each time my heart
                is broken it makes me feel more adventurous,” which is a fine synopsis of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;My Woman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; and
                the glitter that tempers its aching.) “Never Be Mine” sounds like the ’60s in &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4466-caetano-veloso/"&gt;Caetano Veloso&lt;/a&gt;’s Brazil, or
                Spanish guitar music. “Give It Up” puts a pure “Cathy’s Clown” melody over open &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"&gt;Nirvana&lt;/a&gt; strums. They’re love songs, but
                it can never last, and inside all of them, there seems to be a message about the impossibility of
                ownership, which “Not Gonna Kill You” sings: “A love that never seems to curse or to confine/Will be
                forever never lost or too defined... However painful let it break down all of me/’Til I am nothing else
                but the feeling.” Like all of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;My Woman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, it’s tough and tender at once, a bold rumination on how love and autonomy
                require one another.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;And then the record slows. As “Woman” and “&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18508-angel-olsen-sister/"&gt;Sister&lt;/a&gt;” sprawl
                defiantly towards their eight-minute marks, Olsen’s warble stretches into impressionistic waves. The
                command of Olsen’s vibrato is wild but controlled—which is to say anarchic—and as the songs get longer,
                they communicate molecularly, contain more feeling, a haunted drama. The twilight jazz of “Those Were
                the Days” sparkles like city lights in water at night. On the ecstatic and feverish rave-up “Sister,”
                the guitar arrangement is enthralling, putting the starry tone of &lt;i&gt;&lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11853-marquee-moon-adventure/"&gt;Marquee Moon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; inside a scorched &lt;a
                href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31601-crazy-horse/"&gt;Crazy Horse&lt;/a&gt; jam. “I dare you to
                understand,” Olsen later boils, “What makes me a woman.” The answer is in the nonlinear alchemy of her
                corporeal song.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The closer is a raw piano ballad called “Pops.” It is
                impossibly stark. Olsen’s voice sounds like it is pressed up against glass. “If you want the rainbow,”
                Dolly Parton once philosophized, “you have to put up with the rain.” “Pops” is all blurred raindrops,
                recalling &lt;a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/702-cat-power/"&gt;Cat Power&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;You Are Free &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;with
                the wonder of Judy Garland. Olsen sounds like she’s just been emptied of every tear in her body. The
                salt makes “Pops” glisten. It’s so filmic and classic-sounding that you can practically see &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Balloon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;a sole red balloon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
                floating against the grey of a cityscape. “Pops” is Olsen’s heaviest song; it’s exhausting. But if ever
                there were proof that it is possible for life to be gorgeous and fucked-up in equal measure, at the same
                time, this song is it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Burn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Your Fire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; was
                Olsen’s detailed film treatment, but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;My
                Woman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; goes big-screen; it’s Olsen as
                auteur. “Know your own heart well,” she sang in 2010, “You could be surprised at what you find.” But
                part of following your heart, of knowing yourself, is understanding that it’s not a fixed muscle. The
                heart changes; it grows. Its beat speeds and slows as a symptom of life. Here, on “Pops,” Olsen asks,
                “What is it a heart’s made of?” Maybe you never find out for sure; maybe it’s the unending search itself
                that becomes the compass of our being. Love is a maze with no way out. But &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span
                style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;My Woman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;
                suggests that the way in is through self-possession.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
